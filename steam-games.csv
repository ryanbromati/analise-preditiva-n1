Are you zany enough to play the crazier and creepier cousin of Star Realms? Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

When you are preparing for the match, there are some ships of different sizes - from simple battle boat to a huge battleship. You put them on the battlefield and nobody else than you knows their location. Of course, don't know the enemy's positions neither. Thus the battle is absolutely fair and you can only guess where to shoot. Of course, if you hit a battleship for the first time, it will be easy to find the other tiles. However, finding all enemy boats can be a real challenge. Do not forget that this game is not about speed, but about variety, so that the battle is always different.

Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/header.jpg?t=1502354684","","http://www.draw-your-game.com/","contact@zerokcm.fr",True,False,False,0,"",0,18,50,"",43,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Zero One","Zero One","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support","Casual","Casual,Platformer,Hand-drawn","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_1678380950ebac84202055083b6203c8e8e0163e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_2c500bf228b7eb77b417e3a33d923ad2a808f852.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_bff6bdf44b1b291473520cc136afbca3f4d50e51.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_d94d37ed784c6f52cb31b795e2c364ed97f45851.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_9b456ef2f86761bc6b63544d272516638efbc09a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_105e22f97a7148e33bd0d6b0791547a3bb58cbed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_caf80ca9da235d21c2f9e9c606aec64a0661dfd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_99272a04bf3261225ea88048764790614e8abd0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689941/movie_max.mp4?t=1501794251"

About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.","['English']","[]","“Unhappy Ever After is the result of a wicked mind’s imagination!” 8/10 – OPN","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/header.jpg?t=1490429559","","http://warpedtales.weebly.com/","the.warped.tales@gmail.com",True,True,True,0,"",0,16,10,"",0,0,"",218,0,218,0,"Warped Tales","Warped Tales","Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,Indie,RPG,RPGMaker,Dark Fantasy,Fantasy,Magic,Dark Comedy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_2633a000f0c52ddd4aaa4f6ba6f92315b72c6b32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_97f13cdc8e0f2efac222d00dcad65c2f9f786a92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_845b2a32cc31afa264587e4bff3dfcb47780a7eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c643f2814b34930b2faae562237dd1336822c024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_1aaae69f2399d3df81056fcfa3ce28dcbff249ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_22f70f34e4a7e39fdb2aa9841748cc7bbb18ac7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_453a0e5bc82e5401a1742d7a955d5a1832a5d7b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_10a74a79352a5e13607fa2b7c732186d1c67d6e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c81c5b477bc32a9ba0893a796bc7a5ba89ea0633.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_47190db23d847f648333e806eeddb925a1b0f4c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_65944ebf80f21df256b8f18b60a1c38deacff9a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_89840d572dbe7c7bb22c7796b0d511c75aaf0fe1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_88d55d2249385460a434e802c4f73568dbeca5f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_577784115f5550de311960100799a53cbf92a9de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_4faf9305ca187c787f315a3e1764181cdbfa5a38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_769552b5a36e2d56f3ccb013b155373c0e17f8ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_397be0fa648f76db83662d886f07c4f3de9d679c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_31aa64d32fa7b10b7f94ab51408210825056c842.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_0a8a52501655c6e2869376868bc5c7bd7ebc8046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677348/movie_max.mp4?t=1483567252"

231330,"Deadfall Adventures","Nov 15, 2013","100000 - 200000",4,0,19.99,0,0,"Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes","['English', 'German', 'Polish', 'French', 'Russian']","['English', 'German', 'Russian']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/header.jpg?t=1561964976","http://www.deadfall-game.com/","","support@quanticlab.com",True,False,True,53,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/deadfall-adventures?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,1716,628,"",50,1140,"",324,0,431,0,"The Farm 51","THQ Nordic","Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Adventure,Action,FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,First-Person,Singleplayer,Puzzle,Zombies,Co-op,Indie,Horror,Survival,Exploration,Open World,Action-Adventure,World War II,Strategy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e53512c37c3b4927efec4ef2dccec62084af5a57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e5660e00480523bab71e5758c6606de0abf9bebf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_eb71d7cb42e05f68b50d14a3d2a8bd60145acb98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6ce7d35e3e24b9f5d35d8ebb27a0ca793ad08361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8b3791b17d55df0461262b23192a725f80de2593.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d30c427a0ce9d8b04ca0809ae71f5356e0204e73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_3109f03c94c404b51e5775ad86a60e81e132ad19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_0ae6376d1947a3907690ed0a725e81d589cf5760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d4e66c6d44b80b5835acabad30cb60292267e922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_ccc8d733e5f5e565ceaa4be6d8edcf6bdab95079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_b6ef227c36746b589e96d57eb3b09fba2d2c1cc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_18bb9893a8c153b743417f8ada5526d7e172170b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_5b3342439c4a7fcb93ab253be906817f849da3e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6338aab220eabdf66b1137d0ad71278b255ce39f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8292d4dd3ea71a927d2b8b09c41a4856e72b59fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_27bd5bdb26ed53217bf31d013e795d0d5376e880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac2586e6d2a200f246c11f399216576bad38dc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac19564f29ac14d3b70f1bbae5d6233284530cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_763fee337f9ec69f6c6724460264e7c92d09c1ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_f70a0c7cc773129ef12bd9ebcaf9bfcba74c637c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029553/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862566,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030185/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862575,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028438/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862584,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030143/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809128,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030092/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809135"

The Garonne Mercenary Corps, which once resisted the Orc's attack, appeared to be more lonely after the head of the team disappeared. The sudden mission of the Rose broke the daily routine of the mercenary group that survived the struggle. Is it a trap? Still an opportunity? What is hidden behind the royal mission? Character introduction: Lei Lizhen: The ace of the Garon Mercenary The 18-year-old girl has calmness and indifference that is inconsistent with her appearance. And the beginning of all this stems from an accident in childhood. Although it is a childhood friend, the relationship between the two has been extremely close. But the trauma of childhood makes RAYMOND 异常 very sensitive to parting. As she grew older, she chose to close her heart and wait for people to become cold. Once thought that power would be omnipotent. She is even more convinced that the world itself is a 'weak meat and strong food', but she does not know that such cognition also shuts out other people's concern for her. Linasha: The appearance is only 12 years old, but has a age of nearly 30 years old. Unlike the cute and well-behaved appearance, as the main magician of the Garon mercenary group Known as the 'flame elf', she not only has superb magical ability.

If so you are not alone. Hugo Banchee is a testosterone-fueled hulk of a man with serious anger management issues and he is in a hurry to get to the gym. Trouble is, it happens to be Pension Day. Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people? Or will he bump into so many that his overwrought heart will implode, leaving him dying in the street? You must preserve some semblance of Hugo's respect for the elderly long enough for him to reach the sanctuary of his beloved gym in Julian Henley's latest hilarious social commentary on modern life! Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles. Helping an old man across the road is a calming experience and will boost Hugo's health, as will catching tranquilizing capsules which occasionally fall in Hugo's path. Keep Hugo alive long enough and you will eventually reach the destination and victory!","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/header.jpg?t=1651033778","","","jhenley123@outlook.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,1,"",0,0,"There is a small amount of mildly offensive language.",0,0,0,0,"Julian Henley","Julian Henley","Single-player","Action,Casual","Action,Casual,Arcade,Pixel Graphics,2D,Cartoony,Funny,Linear,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_3554f50d7f2b332e4dd5544aaea9721424eb3c27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_77f06fc8e4502728f42cd92855a089303f282b01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_449d5dc65de5556cf6a4751d88a45cc1fe2a8db6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_b61f9f1d33f7a02025dd47ccae811f5a581c47b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_9690b616cae80d95cd31c91d01e9e50819e73230.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_17e8964a5be9ce7a3c3cb031ad5882d565d63813.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_50141b7333cba15cdc983aa2806b9590db466131.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_f393400e7addb1cfdac84fde14e3d6cd93d41f79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759250/movie_max.mp4?t=1566330531"

Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world that’s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each player’s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, they’ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every player’s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world? Come up with your own plans, or work with other players to learn secrets you could never find on your own, revealing these factions’ deepest secrets and saving the world from destruction. [PvP Mode] A player vs player combat mode. Players join two teams of 4 TSF pilots and battle one another. The Early Access version of PvP is still in beta, but in the future we’ll be adding: ・More TSFs to fight in. ・Voice chat ・Balance changes and roles to make team play more fun.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/header.jpg?t=1652940346","https://www.project-mikhail.com","https://project-mikhail.com/en/support/","support-mikhail-en@ancr.jp",True,False,False,0,"",0,328,253,"",0,563,"",670,0,670,0,"aNCHOR Inc.,fuzz, Inc.","aNCHOR Inc.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,RPG,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Anime,Mechs,Hack and Slash,Strategy,Sci-fi,Simulation,Dark,Robots,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,RPG,Action,Third Person,Adventure,Tactical,Swordplay,Spectacle fighter,Early Access,PvP,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_99d86dcae78e23378dc1a5da0a65abf3a472e09c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9d4c4aa8936728fba70562df891b3f173b1a6428.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_8019583ecbf9fa9ce1f0d6e43623e5c8cb507475.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9cc13a574d7a0286f74195c6610fa4b41e9a28c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_0a3840381970cb1d9487d8024a477d106fe5b31f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_7c4620218a3c3ce260bb5300578d30343a29c8f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_1a9482cae60ddc8ada6a7f343666a661b401bc8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_960b58bb69e087c8b558c668fc4c7a2cc3aa1d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_07439c6cc1ad6a558a1510dc74ab0673e989f2fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_003cc058eea0de30292c8fb6029d8fee137441d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_e653d2d90e5b13bee943cc2cd3f9aa8e981b4111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256847596/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361467,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256858534/movie_max.mp4?t=1635832857,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256857340/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361475"
1128520,"Rezist: Tower Defense","Sep 26, 2019","0 - 20000",0,0,0.99,0,0,"Welcome to the virtual world. There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system — your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/header.jpg?t=1589792761","","","hydrargyrum2.0@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,8,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"SparkGames","SparkGames","Single-player","Indie,Strategy","Strategy,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_4be639c00f5f0aebe2af86ee8c5b45f6a8f674a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_016c6384567bc24e253133bcb075416e92c69ea4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_2d1b02e13cf6056b6413f82346bdedc6263ab9d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_e587cf3a36df2bbbfcec630d44921ad0ba3f4bbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_c5d0e1447b631236160fe332bbecb23b2b91fed2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_52dc9d15a04744562d88298b5e9eec9caec62f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_717b8e12f40a7cb4b4e9613b19d4f15aa60fddb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760113/movie_max.mp4?t=1567602189"

Master and summon 15 different spirits with unique abilities. 15+ hours of story and gameplay. SUMMARY In a regional city in the present day, Sayaka Mimuro manages her family's Shinto shrine on behalf of her absent parents. Along with her childhood friend Haru and a talking furball (rabbit?) god, she lives a peaceful life, but when an earthquake strikes, aggressive spirits suddenly appear and her world is torn apart. Sayaka receives divine tidings that the only one who can save the city is herself—she's actually an Onmyoji with the power to vanquish spirits! However, in order to unlock her powers, she must first perform certain rituals with a man... '...If I'm the only one who can do it, then I guess I have no choice!' Sayaka is bewildered to say the least, but her natural sense of justice gives her the resolve to fight... 'There is only one person I can ask to do this and that's you, Haru... Please?' With no one else to turn to, Sayaka asks a confused Haru to be the male partner she needs for her rituals. With his help, Sayaka finally unlocks her battle-princess powers to wage war on the spirits that ravage her city... CHARACTER Heroine: Sayaka Mimuro Voice: Yui Sakakibara “Nothing is impossible if you give it your all.” A hardworking and beautiful girl with a strong sense of justice. Although Sayaka herself doesn't know it, she's descended from a line of Onmyoji sorcerers, and the powers of exorcism slumber within her. She was brought up to be responsible, and she'll never abandon anyone in need. She also tries to see the best in every situation—even the bad one that her dutiful nature has gotten her into now. When it comes to love, she has as much of an interest as anyone else, but the shrine work she does in her parents' stead has always kept her too busy to date.

Good-Knight is a Butt-clenching Arcade Metal Game influenced by games like Super-Hexagon, Castlevania, and Touhou. It's almost genre-less as it fuses genres like Shooters Rhythm Puzzle Bullet-Hell. Game Play You only need one button because you only have one job- survive from the bullet hell! Use the arrow key or joystick to aim your attack. Destroy the bullet shooting enemy can make your survival much easier, but definitely not necessary.

For rookies, we recommend using the bullet time button when the situation is intensified. It can save you anytime you want, the knight has already mastered this ability so that you can unlimitedly use it. However, 'Don't abuse it! You will be punished for playing with time!' -Said by a wise guy. Compete with your friends and players around the world on the leaderboard!

Mixed culture: Philippine horrors, history and literature fuse with Greek stories “You got a reverse Centaur (a man with a head of a horse) called Tikbalang, a Smoking treeman who smokes so much, that creates fog so people get lost in the mountains, and the Aswang which is a traditional Vampire but with a twist where it dislocates its lower body and flies away looking for victims at night.” -Zaid Al-Shaheed, co-founder of Team Good Knight Experience the blockbuster visual and audio enjoyment -Atmosphere rendering inspired by Devil May Cry and Castlevania . -Multiple camera angles: automatically angle switch follows game progress. -Original metal soundtrack. -Plus your neat game control! Invite your friends to play with you! Online or in-person.

457140,"Oxygen Not Included","Jul 30, 2019","2000000 - 5000000",7507,0,24.99,0,2,"In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you’re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them!","['English', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean', 'Russian']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean', 'Russian']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/header_alt_assets_6.jpg?t=1654189805","https://www.kleientertainment.com/games/oxygen-not-included","","livesupport@kleientertainment.com",True,True,True,86,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/oxygen-not-included?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,82902,3014,"",45,80467,"",3574,1441,1003,2777,"Klei Entertainment","Klei Entertainment","Single-player,Steam Trading Cards","Indie,Simulation","Colony Sim,Base-Building,Survival,Resource Management,Building,Singleplayer,Management,Simulation,2D,Sandbox,Strategy,Space,Indie,Sci-fi,Exploration,Open World,Difficult,Adventure,Early Access,Multiplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_78d1c92edeecc7b17cafa9248867fe7d4390a0a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_67ab224dd8c781d5a27ee52657173298873d439a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_ba2b8c362327add29b08182d13b04bf502e065cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_c5e20abaf2c82f9156da9c80b2ec7c0aefc46254.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_24a4ffeaf41ea6d782fef203177243d36c185506.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_02af9f36ca186bba1d0f2d5819d169e741076b46.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_a481601e529d5fd3acc25a55557dfd1775cc6c96.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_936e1756325dbd936f5b5227bdfb3357b57b356c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256757654/movie_max.mp4?t=1564503300,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256732663/movie_max.mp4?t=1540515738,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256685295/movie_max.mp4?t=1495142922,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256719917/movie_max.mp4?t=1528996831,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708317/movie_max.mp4?t=1518112971,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256701212/movie_max.mp4?t=1510854853,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256693600/movie_max.mp4?t=1503595564,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256665154/movie_max.mp4?t=1465840964"

Neon Nights 2 Skylines - A cyberpunk styled purple and blue neon themed table with a pulse pounding synth style soundtrack. Outergalactic Aliens - A remake of last year's table with all new LEDs, and the addition of the slot machine. PLEASE NOTE: This title is built on the Unity engine and there is a slight delay while playing if you use BOTH shift keys at the same time to control the flippers. This is a known issue with the Unity engine. We recommend picking ONE shift key on either side and then using another key to control the other flipper such as S/L, CTRL or Tab. The entire game's soundtrack currently spans close to two hours, not including all of the sound effects and victory/defeat riffs. Features full controller support, mouse / keyboard support, and the Steam online leaderboards to rank your final score for each table. No subscription, monthly fees, or tickets required to enjoy some good ol' fashion pinball. What do the Steam curators have to say about this title? Check it out!

TowerClimb is set in a fantasy world where enormous and mysterious towers of ancient unknown origin stand above humanity, extending to the heavens. Humans are driven by curiosity to climb them, usually dying in the process. Struggle forward as a weak human, driven by an iron will to reach the top. The game borrows elements from the roguelike genre. A different adventure awaits each man; you will never play the same exact level twice. Run, Climb, Jump, Swim, and Fly your way up the tower's atmospheric and lethal worlds, using items and resources you find along your way. Quick thinking and strategy will keep you alive as you navigate the tower using unique platforming mechanics. TowerClimb is challenging, and rewards reflexes, skill, knowledge and problem solving ability. Quite often, The tower throws your character into dangerous situations which require you to think very carefully about your actions. A unique, randomly generated level system ensures players must always come up with interesting ways to complete a level. Hundreds of men will die before you posses enough skill and knowledge to conquer the tower. A screenshot of every man's death is saved, along with how he died, to track each and every attempt. TowerClimb at its core is an adventure platformer, with procedural levels and elements based on the rogue-like genre. It features local multiplayer support with an option for split-screen/single-screen. (a maximum of 25 simultaneous players is the limit. However, the game only supports 4 controllers (Xinput limitation). The remaining players must use the keyboard. A program like Xpadder can remap additional directinput controllers to keyboard keys) The game features a TON of content. The Tower is tall and daunting to conquer, with plenty of areas and secrets throughout the game. Getting/seeing everything will take players a long time. There's bonus modes to unlock and play on top of the main game as well. Each time you play the game, everything changes. The levels are different, random events can occur, rare items can be found, etc. The game will always keep you on your feet and give you refreshing challenges and experiences. The platforming mechanics in the game are set up to feel very tight and responsive in combination with the climbing mechanics. You always need to be on your feet and aware of your surroundings, while continually planning how to climb higher. As you progress higher, different worlds introduce new mechanics that mean your play style must evolve. 5 years in the making, by Davioware and Quazi, a team of two brothers who have been developing and playing games since childhood.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/header.jpg?t=1452807494","http://www.davioware.com","http://www.davioware.com/forum/","davioware@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,288,28,"",0,228,"",53,0,53,0,"Davioware and Quazi","Davioware and Quazi","Single-player,Multi-player,Shared/Split Screen,Partial Controller Support,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Indie,Action Roguelike,Action,Adventure,Rogue-lite,Pixel Graphics,RPG,Platformer,Difficult,Procedural Generation,Great Soundtrack,2D,Rogue-like,Local Co-Op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_e31dc45661bba44a4fd063bc6ed4799411b265e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_3b1f72b79430b6935a6eebfd76bbcd681c443a3e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_336a61fdfb2111120c4048bc8df5416ea8dcf1b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_85ebb18e02ec298a7c2a09a955e95dbe9a3d67e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_e7fea8248e4e93d034328bae62e45c125f31ed03.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_421e546bb493472bd837fc1c22d69b57e576f208.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_3c2415648682479e48182a8ed9296b1d1c1677c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_ae90957dd60a4ca02567a9a1e78683c2e4b45263.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_372fb5385d3f89623527898701cf2f52b842ce07.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_7ab682072d7e925760570a060e14ec340dee666d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_c099acfcb0acf6089635b6406678bd14d0a326f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_2ee449eb319952219dcbf40c1ece4a341ed9ed22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656588/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378175"

695420,"Hex: Origins","Sep 23, 2017","0 - 20000",0,0,1.99,0,0,"Hex: Origins is a casual puzzle game based on a complete hexagon themed colorful experience. Enjoy a refreshing, calming and original experience, which is extremely easy to pick up but hard to master as you progress in the game. Across the multitude of game modes and levels you will encounter, you must place pieces composed of anywhere from 2 to 10 and more hexagons, each using up to 6 different colors. Everything in the game is based on two simple rules: You can place a piece anywhere on the board with no restrictions as long as all the neighboring tiles are empty. If one hex has a colored neighbor on the board, at least one of those neighbors needs to match its color. Building upon these simple rules, we added special board pieces and power-ups in order to create a fun and colorful experience. As long as you keep placing pieces on the board, its requirements for placing pieces change - so be careful about the order, colors and type of shapes you can use. Always plan ahead! Gameplay Hex: Origins offers you 4 different game modes, 2 available from the start, and 2 unlocked with tokens you earn while playing the game: Classic: a linear experience bundled up in Episodes, structured into 6 Chapters, each containing 6 Levels that you can play in 3 difficulties. Each Episode introduces new mechanics into gameplay and with each passing chapter, the difficulty is slightly raised - but so are the rewards! Flow: a linear experience similar to Classic, with the added requirement of connecting various battery pieces to light bulbs in order to power them up! Carefully plan your colored ways across the board and take up the challenge! Don't forget to fill up the board, though. Exploration: Give up the static board and expand in any direction! Exploration maps feature a center starting point with all the colors onto which you will start expanding in any direction you want. Treasure Hunting: On rare occasions you will find treasure map fragments. Assemble them into a map and embark on a  thematic journey in order to find the hidden treasures of Hex: Origins. Always remember that X marks the spot! Features Over 800 levels of ever-increasing challenges with 3 difficulty options Dynamic level difficulty &amp; no unique solutions: the moves you make always alter the possible shapes that can be placed thus making it easier or harder for yourself. As you place these pieces the game will try to generate pieces that you can use. Plan ahead carefully. Finish a level in any way possible! Shuffle mechanic: discard existing pieces and draw new ones in exchange for a tiny fraction of your progress bar. 5 power-ups that you can use to slightly alter or completely change the game board. Special bonus shapes: from time to time a difficult to place piece will appear (9+ hex piece). Place it on the board and successfully finish the level and earn extra rewards. Complete in-game quests that range from easy to hard and get awesome rewards! Open treasure chests and reap the rewards while you complete any level! Unlock custom hex piece skins. Customize your board with that extra bling! Customize the game experience with 9 beautiful backgrounds! Cloud saving, achievements, stats, leaderboards, level editor, workshop and soon trading cards!","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/header.jpg?t=1506349129","http://www.prettybatgames.com","","support@prettybatgames.com",True,True,True,0,"",0,8,0,"",19,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Pretty Bat Games","Pretty Bat Games","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Includes level editor","Casual,Indie","Indie,Casual,Puzzle,Relaxing,Hex Grid","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_88a2d562f3cfb51c39a6d7da5e125647e7f6e0a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_29a7f4cace17983f0d24e24c9d21d9187c21705e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_e68c06dba41ddf880de3b08cb7570c442fdc77df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_e435d58d88188756f53c2e690e88c60cdd4893c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_a6f9877114ad5863c3a42ec6b4b0e789e25bda7e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256696474/movie_max.mp4?t=1506349123,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256692410/movie_max.mp4?t=1504948567,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256696408/movie_max.mp4?t=1506287071"

The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096","http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us","http://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/support/","support@koeitecmo.co.uk",True,False,False,0,"",0,3075,6009,"",44,5946,"",215,15,76,15,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together","Action","Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

All have a festive viking/celtic/pirate style, which will make you feel the viking power in you! Simple gameplay: Following the tradition of arcade games, Ragnarock is easy to play, hard to master. To move forward, only your sense of rhythm matters. However, to win the race, you will have to train and use your skills wisely. Multiple difficulty settings will help you improve over time. Only the most experienced players will be able to collect all the gold medals, beat the high scores and sign their name on the leaderboard! Cross-platform multiplayer mode: The multiplayer PvP mode brings real-time competition against your friends or other people. Start a public or private game (up to 6 players) and beat them all to finish in first place! In solo, you can also race against ghost ships (representing your best score or other players from the leaderboard) to add some competition. Mythological environments: Ragnarock transports you to the land of the vikings in stylized environments inspired by nordic mythology.

To stop the evil, you’ll need a focused team and perfect execution, with a single session lasting up to an hour. CAN YOU BANISH EVIL TOGETHER? Each themed DEVOUR map not only brings a terrifying new manifestation of the goat demon Azazel, but also completely new environments to explore, items to collect, fiends to overcome, and forbidden rituals to perform. Exorcise the demonically possessed Your goal is to break Azazel's hold on the cultists. On each map, work together in a race against time to find key ritual items – some of which might be alive and unwilling - to complete the banishment. Escalating difficulty Each possessed cultist’s rage and speed increases as the game progresses, as does the number of fiends they spawn to stop you. Your only means of defence is your UV flashlight. Replayability Locked doors, ritual objects and item spawns are randomized, ensuring that no two games are the same.

This game is filled with rich main and side stories, several mini-games. It also features: - Dynamic day-night cycle, which takes an important place in the game mechanic. - Calendar system: the game records the story of Yima village between April and September. - Character development: Fighting monsters, Learning skills, Upgrading character levels and weapons, a simplified RPG experience. - NPC reputation: improving NPCs’ reputations by giving gifts and spending time with them to unlock side stories. The production team led by the leader of the team – Baohua, comes to build a new village in the deep forest and accidentally find a lost person of unknown origin, the MC – Mayi. After deciding to take Mayi with the team, Mayi witnesses the process of the village from nothing to something as a helper. From the beginning to the end, the appearance of the village will be changed drastically! There is plenty of time for the game, and Mayi is also a favored one, and does not need to worry particularly about the difficulty of this game - even if she is inadvertently defeated in battle, it does not mean that the game has failed, and Mayi can even return to the game in a stronger form. (Even skipping time directly to the plot point is possible under certain situations!) Not only the main stories that must happen at a certain point in time, you can also unlock NPC’s side stories by improving their reputations, along with nearly 30 CGs.

Chichester 2 - Part II : No Extra Regrets For The Future","Sep 30, 2021","0 - 20000",0,0,9.99,0,3,"About This Game This predominantly kinetic visual novel has two to three hours of gameplay for the main story and fifteen minutes for each secret scene. Whilst it would be advantageous to have played ' Welcome To... Chichester 2 - Part II : No Regrets For The Future ', this episode can be enjoyed on its own. Not all characters are 18 or over. The Story Grendel Jinx : A lazy, megalomaniacal kleptomaniac Five years ago, she nearly suffered a fatal and self-inflicted accident during a school outing, saved only by the protagonist's fortuitous presence. After rescuing her, the protagonist is promptly coerced into signing a 'Friendship Agreement' form - a document designed to tie the protagonist to Grendel, both personally and financially, and then ultimately for the protagonist to join Grendel's organisation. With the arrival of the last day of term, Grendel needs to hand in her remaining homework or face the prospect of repeating a year. Drafting in the protagonist to solve her problem, Grendel is annoyed when her demands are swiftly rebuffed. Initiating a devious plan to ensure her education can progress without interruption, Grendel's actions soon attract her mother's attention, who has her own nefarious plans for the protagonist. Features By popular demand, CG graphics have now been introduced to enhance the gameplay. Funny and dramatic SHORT story. Gender selection, with gender-specific dialogue at various points in the game. Seven extra stories are available once the main story has been completed : ' Far Too Good For Us ' : Find out why the protagonist ended up in an upgraded broom cupboard (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Thine ' : A parcel arrives for the protagonist. Naturally, Grendel decides to open it (Part I) (accessed from the title screen). ' The Alien From Somewhere Out There ' : Grendel watches an age-inappropriate film (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Within ' : Emily is looking for something (part of the main story). ' Return to Castle Grendel ' : Grendel's classroom story continues (accessed from the title screen). ' We Want Information ' : ??? (part of the main story). ' High Jinx or Bye Jinx ' : The protagonist is a contestant in a gameshow (accessed from the title screen). Internal and Steam achievements (as per usual). Visual impairment settings, a background and CG gallery, and a music player. Both galleries are only available once the main story has been completed. Path and sound notification. Features the musical talents of Jessica Jenks. Genre : Comedy, drama, action. Romance : None (unless you count Grendels love of causing the protagonist problems). Recently signed Grendel's ' Friendship Document ' (more out of pity than anything else). Doesn't realise what exactly that entails. Whenever Grendel gets behind on homework, she takes the easy way out : Force someone to write everything up. With the protagonist now Grendel's 'Best Friend', what better way of starting this friendship than forcing the protagonist to deal with sixteen different assignments ? Miss Potts is Grendels teacher. She dislikes violence. The protagonists current boss. Soon to be the protagonists' secretary and general dogsbody. Absolutely nothing can go wrong there. Wanting nothing more than their daughter to take over the world, the best way of achieving this is through relentless indoctrination and... ultra-violent anime programs.

572330,"The Fan","May 10, 2017","0 - 20000",0,0,5.99,0,0,"The Fan is an interactive photo fiction with real locations and actors. Follow the story of 'The Fan', a serial killer abducting women to fulfill his dark fantasies. His latest catch lies in his basement but she's not ready yet. Everything needs to be perfect for the ritual, when he'll show her 'True love'. The fan is a first person exploration game with a unique twist. Driven by a creepy and unsettling atmosphere, it will take you deep within the darkest places of Paris underground. Gameplay The Fan is entirely made with photos . It has a classic 'point and click' feel, using only left and right click but it's closer to the recent Telltale Game series than to traditional adventures games. There are no painful mini-games or artificially inserted sliding puzzles as it is more about discovery and choices. Find out more about the Killer and his victims as the story unfolds and you may be the one to ultimately decide their fate. WARNING : The game isn't rated yet but I wouldn't recommend if if you're under 16, due to the themes and some violent sequences. More About Me My name is Cyril and I'm a Frenchie indie game dev. The Fan is my first released game ever =) The game was created using Unity Personal Edition and mostly Lightroom for the pictures. I started the project in 2012 and did all the shootings, which was really fun, but when it came to actually 'make a game', well, it took much more time, effort, tutorials, training and hard work than I expected :D Although The Fan is a pretty short experience (there are no overly twisted puzzles to keep you from going fast if you wanna rush it), it took thousands of pictures and a tremendous amount of work to make it look good enough. So please, tell me what you think! Feel free to contact me directly if you have any question or comment, I'll be happy to answer!","['English', 'French']","['English', 'French']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/header.jpg?t=1593004829","http://thefan-game.blogspot.fr/p/about-thefan.html","http://thefan-game.blogspot.fr/p/about-thefan.html","cyril.danon@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,72,43,"",0,0,"",11,0,11,0,"Ezhaac Studio","Plug In Digital","Single-player,Steam Trading Cards","Adventure","Violent,Adventure,FMV,Point & Click","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_fa468acb606b49f742ca71af638208be4d98e237.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_a3ebd7ad69ae9fa5977897da6b2d79e28c9c1e16.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_0f69a0d17d57d6bfb74b855c5f716970eead8ea3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_e6d0da1e520f6cc3795fcae23bcaf38d97c43469.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_a7272a2201aae4570ec7688ddc67f8fd140b9736.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_f0152026f2310ad74f3f4210d92a364c48b01bf6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_710ae5b32f086cc50cd639b42ea42f9495395d90.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_75707ab66d87213beb3819c4d03966d081ac9288.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_91c3a15f59717398882f260edf57f7a20638584b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/572330/ss_79156d65d61f05d49efb4320de2597f06675dc36.1920x1080.jpg?t=1593004829","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256679070/movie_max.mp4?t=1494411412,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256679071/movie_max.mp4?t=1494411421"

926140,"CHANGE: A Homeless Survival Experience","May 1, 2020","100000 - 200000",15,0,14.99,0,1,"CHANGE is an emotional homeless survival experience set in a randomly generated city with rogue-like elements. Explore, survive, earn perks, find items and kindness to develop your character and escape to a new life. With hundreds of perks, items, events and more, this serious game comes with a large amount of depth that opens up the more you play, and changes based on how you play. 20% of Delve Interactive's profits from this game will be donated to charities focused on the issue of homelessness. This is a hate letter to the growing indifference in the world. When members of the development team almost fell into homelessness some years ago, it inspired us to create something that gives a voice to the forgotten and the vulnerable. We take the subject very seriously and portray it as such. After over 7 years of research and hard work, 100s of updates and fan support, we bring you our tale of survival and isolation. Choose from 5 different characters each with their own background stories and maladies, then create your own story Find companions and find kindness. Build a reputation or even friendships with various characters including the other homeless and the police Build your inventory with food, survival tools, clothing and more... as well as unlocking new items for your next playthrough as you progress Spend a night in police stations, parks or shelters, spend time at bars, visit the clinic, study in the library, recycle scrap and more as you discover new areas and buildings Learn about the lives of the homeless and everything they go through to survive, with every part of the truth having been heavily researched by the developers Experience a beautifully composed emotional soundtrack Manage your hunger, hygiene, happiness, crime levels, street reputation, study levels and other stats as you try to survive and escape the homeless life. But you can only do so much in one day... what will you do? Will you spend the day begging, depending on the kindness of others? Will you find shelter in the night? Perhaps you're moved out of the area by the police for loitering. Unable to find shelter, you end up on the streets at night, and you meet a dog. Is it a stray? Could it be a friend? All your actions affect your happiness in some way, and it's up to you to manage your stats accordingly. You could turn to drink, but risk addiction. You could hope for a fortunate event, or make some progress towards your survival. But you will have to choose. It could all be over if a bad event occurs in the dangerous night streets. Especially during winter. Every game is different, and with each playthrough comes more ways to explore CHANGE. If you became homeless... what would you do? PLANS Our goal with this project is to raise awareness on the issue of homelessness, as well as raise money for it. We have done a ton of research for this project and while our wish is to portray the reality of homelessness, various aspects of sleeping rough have been abstracted for the sake of gameplay. So far, we've raised over £7000 for the charities CRISIS, The Clocktower Sanctuary and Shelter. Join us in the community section to discuss the game with the team! We're always listening and awaiting your feedback.","['English', 'German', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Spanish - Spain']","[]","“With this rich, emotional overlay, coupled with some deep, appealing mechanics, CHANGE is an enthralling survival experience from start to finish.” New Game Network “Change is a gritty, hand-crafted, labor of love that transcends its simple, pixilated aesthetic. It asks questions of the player which will hopefully be pondered at some point during playthroughs. I know I did.” CyberPowerPC “PREVIEW: ...the game says a bit more, a bit more deeply, about being homeless.

739720,"Penkura","Dec 19, 2018","0 - 20000",1,0,9.99,0,0,"Penkura combines the wonderful worlds of real-time strategy and first-person exploration. Easy to pick up but hard to master, Penkura utilizes classic death mechanics that leave you without your equipment each time you perish. For this reason, you are able to construct your own robotic companions to help you build bases, gather resources, and protect your settlement. It encourages players to choose from a variety of approaches through which to complete their goals. Players will find themselves becoming an expert in areas entirely of their choosing. The intention is that, when the co-op is unveiled, players will find that the interaction of their unique skillsets with those of their peers creates capable and rewarding team gameplay. Penkura offers buildings, machines, bots, and items for you to construct. Most of it is made with the 'MMC' (Molecular Matter Converter) or through 'CCC' (Command Control Communication), which provides a top-down camera similar to that of classic RTS games. Should you desire, you can take control of your own intrepid bot to scout out a potentially hazardous environment or repair your base without stepping outside of the safety of your home. This is only the beginning of CCC potential; the rest is in your hands. Penkura’s crafting and base construction systems are made with co-op already in mind. Before its final release, you’ll be able to cooperate with other players to create huge, complex sets of items and stations that would normally take more than twice as long to put together. Deep beneath Antarctic ice, a Polish research team discovered an ancient temple that appeared to be a gateway to a fascinating new world.  The idea to migrate mankind to a new planet was a blessing for an overpopulated and devastated Earth. Project 'Gemini' was launched to colonize the new world. For 41 years, brave men and women traveled through the temple’s singularity.

These three aspects come together to create a game that offers a unique experience that is both rewarding, and satisfying.","['English']","['English']","6.5/10 – Co-Op Couple","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/header.jpg?t=1447374965","http://threeprongproductions.com","http://threeprongproductions.com","threeprongproductionsgames@gmail.com",True,False,True,0,"",0,5,2,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Three Prong Productions","Three Prong Productions","Single-player","Action,Indie,RPG","Action,RPG,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4f420cc0b695474101d498a1548432a024e91454.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_d7dea9e2e860e5106ec7cc426debeb052621dcb7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4fadedf78c2febc4570bc0161e06b7e330c6c4c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_4db382f9078eee4c570d73572e1eba3bf261348a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_cf197c5bfdc433b55afdbb4d0f26f99081ceac7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/372770/ss_915a05cd832938cec1bbce4f386b4d5fa0f01852.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447374965","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2039451/movie_max.mp4?t=1447374977"

As such, Minds Eyes uses many elements that should not normally be combined in a proper horror game. None the less, through all of your feedback, videos and discussions, I was able to transform all of the successes and failures into my subsequent titles: A Girls Fabric Face and Suit 776. To that, I thank you all! :)) Minds Eyes brings you to a world of dreams. You wake up from your slumber to constantly discover you are still asleep. You venture throughout your own home as well as some pieces of your imagination to discover who or what is keeping you at sleep. Will you ever wake up? will you ever finish the journey? Venture through tense full moments of a chilling and nerve wrecking atmosphere that will keep you wondering 'When will something happen!'. Interact with the game and collect game objects which will overall affect your score in the end. Can you locate all game items?, can you make it without a single death? Check what the mind has in store. NOTE: This game is to be played with a single sitting. The estimated game time is 30-45min. This game also includes flashing lights. If flashing lights affect any of your medical conditions, please avoid the game. **SO! what is Minds Eyes really? think of it as an experiment. I have developed Minds Eyes to experiment with new mechanics, features, animations, interactions, and more. Ultimately, I am using this game to gather information in order to build my ultimate horror experience. Think of it as research and development!. I will be watching a large portion of videos that you all send out to me, and note what was good and bad. With that said, If possible, please give me a full on review of the game. Tell me what you likes, disliked and/or would change. This will ultimately let me know what to, and what not to include in future projects.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/header.jpg?t=1569810949","","","Stash329@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,1078,440,"",0,0,"",30,0,31,0,"Stanislaw Truchowski","TurnVex","Single-player","Action,Adventure,Free to Play,Indie","Horror,Free to Play,Multiplayer,Action,Survival Horror,Adventure,Indie,Thriller,Psychological Horror,Singleplayer,First-Person,Co-op,Experimental,FPS,Online Co-Op,Anime,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_4435487ee1186386e7f84e016dc7263feea0aa58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_6a433732398231d599984f5bb51441f33475e1c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_db38c8e2b9c2570dc19f6313d338ec3bd8797f82.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_fada7355c88bf4557d8ac895a8bd0682dcd2c899.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_402dd626c12ff2d97a539f662c5b6a3b84109014.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_4864ecf8491367c1b8dd73b419037c9ffd5feaa9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949",""

Make sure to play this game in order to understand Heroes of Time 2 which is coming soon. This game takes place 1000 years after the events of Tales of Ágaris, in the year of 2130. Long forgotten are days of strife and conflict. Robots have been manufactured to assist with the police to keep the peace and security of the lands. Yet, not all is quite tranquil. A scientist, named, Aizack, uses his own robots to fuel a machine that he build to go back in time. To make the world one of his own design, he aims to steal a certain magical necklace that has lost it's potency in the modern age. However, 1000 years ago, it had the capability of summoning extremely powerful demons. The era that Aizack needs to visit coincides with the emergence of Gorgos, which was a dark moment in history.

In the wake of the Noble Faction’s occupation of Heimdallr, civil war has broken out across Erebonia. The provincial armies, loyal to the aristocracy and the Four Great Houses, have claimed many of the nation’s great cities in the name of the Noble Alliance. The Imperial Army, called back from the four corners of the Empire, has only just begun its sweeping counterattack. After Rean managed to escape Trista with Celine and Valimar, he awakens in the mountains near his hometown uncertain what fate befell his friends, who bravely threw themselves in harm’s way to buy him time to flee. Though the road will not be an easy one, Rean decides to take up his sword again, journeying across Erebonia with his Divine Knight, Valimar, in search of his friends from Class VII and a way to end the conflict before its price becomes far too dear… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Taking place on the same continent as the fan favorite Trails in the Sky offshoot of Nihon Falcom’s storied The Legend of Heroes franchise, Trails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II in Japanese) is a direct sequel to Trails of Cold Steel, picking up one month after the decisive collision that changed the fate of the entire nation of Erebonia. The speedy, tactical turn-based combat with the newly-developed “ARCUS” system returns with all the bells and whistles together with the new Overdrive mode, new means of transportation both across the land and sky, new allies, new dangers, and a renewed sense of hope as Rean tirelessly works to right the wrongs that have led the country to disarray. KEY FEATURES A Direct Sequel that Remembers the Past Clear data from Trails of Cold Steel carries over into Trails of Cold Steel II, granting players bonuses, and most importantly, remembering the many relationships cultivated during time spent at Thors Military Academy, allowing for more personalized conversations throughout the story. Take to the Land and Sky in New Modes of Transportation Fast travel isn’t just for Trista anymore; a personalized airship now allows players to swiftly choose and descend upon both familiar and foreign destinations alike—and on land, horseback riding not only returns, but players can now customize and utilize Angelica’s orbal bike for fast transportation across the map. The Link System Returns with a new Overdrive Mode Bonding with allies continues to pay off with the Combat Link System, netting a variety of combat benefits including healing, guarding, and more, and the new Overdrive mode allows linked characters to attack up to three turns in a row for new strategic battle options. Experience the Game as Never Before 50% more lines of English voice-overs have been added to the PC release, bringing a fresh experience to even those who have played it before on console. New features for this release include ultrawide aspect ratio support, turbo mode, and an instant resume feature that allows players to launch directly from Steam to their most recent save.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/header.jpg?t=1624575761","http://www.trailsofcoldsteel.com/cs2/","","support@xseedgames.com",True,False,False,81,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-ii?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,2113,125,"",51,1992,"",4495,0,8126,0,"Nihon Falcom","XSEED Games,Marvelous USA, Inc.","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","RPG","JRPG,RPG,Anime,Story Rich,Great Soundtrack,Turn-Based,Singleplayer,Mechs,Fantasy,Romance,Turn-Based Combat,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_6dea04af73ae5d627709d8c5f4e2915d853ab915.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_19987af42f6d8291e4ca576a164d8889d95d4295.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_9e5559f21b1cc1171a9380fe51f1179922d35ad2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_aee59e52d82c780e2fb858afbded2968f2d46057.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_ae9eb7689f95e1040f02247f1ca53e037809a1af.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_17cbcda4f4ab6d5e63682d612aa02b50e014f7a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_35971c69aed991097bba64fb5db2f494851d3717.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/748490/ss_f192cc7fc5f9d9bb44f7f98dc57024c3e3869d10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624575761","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708880/movie_max.mp4?t=1551805118,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256706454/movie_max.mp4?t=1551805134"

544220,"Damage: Sadistic Butchering of Humanity","Dec 11, 2016","0 - 20000",0,0,4.2,0,0,"THE GAME Damage is a violent but humorous 2D-adventure-shooter based on Amiga cult classic which was originally released in 1996. The idea of Damage is simple: kill as many people as possible! Damage is an adventure game where you can roam freely in a wide urban setting, loot money and goods, buy weapons and other equipment from the black market and kill thousands of enemies: harmless civilians, policemen, army troopers, organised criminals, bloodhounds and vehicles. DSBoH is humoristic and harmless outlet for our violent instincts. THE STORY In Damage you take control of a formerly exemplary man named Michael Modelcitizen, who had everything a man could possibly dream of. Because of that, he soon became deeply frustrated. Michael tried various methods in search of a new super human state, but during the process something went terribly wrong. The solution to regaining his previous status is ugly. Michael starts with a primitive baseball bat, taking out unaware passers-by. It's not long before Michael's actions begins to attract the members of authority - who all try to eliminate him. Of course, he has access to numerous appetising weapons, and he starts experimenting with dangerous drugs to keep himself alive. In Damage, you play as Michael and we guarantee you many, many delightful discoveries and a feeling of extreme freedom to venture and express yourself.

Meet a variety of NPCs from the different races of the land: THE HETONIANS are intelligent and cunning.

They worship the Shapers, creators of Talumos, as well as the five true gods of the Moonlight Realm. Their devotion to the preservation of nature often leads to warring with the other races when their land is threatened. THE FORLORN are cursed dragon-like humanoids who live far away in the Skyreach Peaks. Historically shunned and scattered, the Forlorn are resentful of the other races and wait for their warleaders to lead them to glory in battle. THE FALLEN are what happens when the Black Flame, a power from another realm, is used to transform an entire nation. The result is a corrupting and undying sinister legion, led by a mad king, attempting to bring ruin to every living thing in Talumos.

She was a Franco-Spanish painter and a key figure in the pictorial revival that took place in Europe during the First World War. Her relentless artistic career, her impressive biography as a genius from the time she was a child with physical difficulties, and her extraordinary intelligence made her stand out, especially as a member and only woman of L'école de Paris, a star and an essential figure of Cubism. She became one of the most important characters of the 20th century avant-garde art. This virtual gallery is intended to pay tribute to the great artist on the 90th anniversary of her death in Paris, and to introduce her work and language as a painter and theoretician to the interested public. Her new languages and the most advanced techniques are shown in 65 works never seen before. This museum has several rooms marked by key dates in its history, accompanied by a virtual character who, from a few monitors, explains her biography in a playful and didactic way, corresponding to the works exhibited in each space. It can be played either in PCVR mode or as a desktop application in first-person mode.","['Spanish - Spain']","['Spanish - Spain']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2026860/header.jpg?t=1656711572","","","stkm@stkm.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,0,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Virtual Video","Virtual Video","","Design & Illustration,Education","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2026860/ss_f777fea541f139a212919a2e223d1a91bc808b8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656711572,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2026860/ss_0455e297b8e6ae2a1e522397c6a740155f367ef0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656711572,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2026860/ss_1b4b77419c47656208aa001a8c41347db8232fca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656711572,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2026860/ss_a74e68a314f1fb15f80404f2b44e3e0988c5a440.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656711572,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2026860/ss_c48bf9e6c10c9fe3391c926fd6144a644fb5f4cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656711572,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2026860/ss_96e296e01bd4c34bae9c1a9dfdf7244b3cf650f6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656711572,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2026860/ss_2b3fd65a32045f57e28a3e3e222853da039f7198.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656711572","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256890559/movie_max.mp4?t=1655258019"

What the game is about: Honey Rose: UFE tells the story of Red, a young university student with dreams of making it big at the masked fighting tournament . She looks up to Big Blue , the current champion, and aims to meet her idol in the ring ! However, she has a history of poor class attendance , and has repeatedly failed her latest classes. This year, she made a deal with her parents : she’d either graduate, or they’d change towns. Unfortunately, the masked fighting tournament also takes place for the first time in the very town Red lives in... making it her one and only chance to make her dream come true! Thankfully, that’s where you come in ! With your guidance, she needs to balance her studies with her training so she can bring home both the champion's belt, and her graduation. The game is a life-management simulation , presented as a visual novel , with beat'em-up elements . In short: some reading, a little fighting... and lots of planning! Features: A visual novel based around choice and reactivity! See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment! A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue! Fight for your dreams in the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street! Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation! Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both? Pricing The game uses a 'pay-what-you-liked' remuneration model. 'Pay-what-you-liked' is a system designed after 'pay-what-you-want', except you choose to support the game *after* having played it for yourself , and determined its personal value based on your own experience. It is designed to offer each player the most choice possible in how, when and why when considering whether to support the game or not . Since Steam doesn't support 'pay-what-you-liked' or 'pay-what-you-want' remuneration systems, the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support . IMPORTANT NOTE : buying DLC stands in for supporting the game at the value of the suggested tier. It will NOT enhance or change your ingame experience, you will not be getting additional content other players can't access , as the aim for this system is for the game to be the same for everyone: ie, its most complete state right off the bat! That also means the game is NOT F2P/P2W: there is NO in-game economy that allows you to pay for additional content. The game is fully available for free from the minute you start playing it!","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/header.jpg?t=1478020022","http://pehesse.fr/honey/","","honeyUFE@gmail.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,32,9,"",37,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Pehesse","Self","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy,Visual Novel,Female Protagonist,Beat 'em up,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_09e82a595abc068ad4a27e8fad05576f46411d33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_787917ee9afb79fd2bf5d442d46a0b43c43d8bfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_0a67f4a7c2031187b0460de021e0d569f6875983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_a6a1bd8104824fad0b9b398ee7fd70242672bd72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_702b0c1e792a0b4f3c7dd43a1bad9193a41a725b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_6b04fc096767209ed2a15412b29b0fef97e0117f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_687a63ca117854407dfc96811f4171dd3e87bad0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_f4b67258f40fb937e28389c2db1a3032a65ffaa8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_bdb4e00f3971ba91b1bde9ba5f56d3db79654e79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_9064fd49444f8e84e60e1aaf04bd9021b3faa733.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_e87d876362f4f00f5d6e7d117040144e89d3081c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_94dc8365b330b6edb957e7ebbcb4d59145349848.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_a143f73252403c449a1dcee8566351ea3c2621cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_d4421cf7267c3a916f693241d2f80e193427cf9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256670193/movie_max.mp4?t=1473458904,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256670194/movie_max.mp4?t=1473458916"

3010,"Xpand Rally","Aug 24, 2006","20000 - 50000",2,0,4.99,0,0,"Xpand Rally is a breathtaking game that gives you the true to life experience of driving powerful rally cars amidst photorealistic sceneries. Realistic weather effects, rolling hills, and animated scenery all add to game's visual perfection. Xpand Rally also features highly detailed models of modern rally cars and handling physics developed with the help of rally sport professionals which further enhance the realism of driving experience. Xpand Rally combines the best elements of Rally and Rally Cross racing in one unique gaming experience. The game offers a career mode based on time trials during both individual races and World Championship Series which will satisfy traditional Rally fans. The Rally Cross fans won't be disappointed either - they can challenge several opponents in head to head racing during competitions based on real and fictitious race events. Xpand Rally, as the only title on the market, brings the economy factor into a rally game. The player starts with a junk car and competes in races to earn money and acquire upgrades, repair damage, tweak performance and pay the race entry fees. Along with the tuning-up, the car's condition affects its handling. Due to accurate damage system, it is highly dependent on the player's driving skills.

1986310,"猎魔战纪","May 25, 2022","0 - 0",0,0,0.0,0,1,"先声明本游戏战斗有一定难度，并不适合喜欢玩挂机刷刷刷的朋友。 由于并没有太多的测试人员，主要是我自己在测试，即便我玩了很多遍，但难免会有遗漏和不合理的地方。 如果有出现BUG或者大家觉得有某些地方难度不合理，希望大家能积极反馈，评论区留言或者进群@都行！感谢各位赏脸游玩！ 游戏着有不同于其他回合制游戏的战斗机制，每个角色有着独特且能产生质变的天赋加点，你可以把角色按你想的方向上培养。 但是注意你的天赋需要与你主要使用的技能搭配，才能发挥最大效果。 本游戏需要注意的点： 1.很多技能释放需要tp点，我们可以通过加攻速或者加tp回复来提高tp获取效率。 2.技能每次使用会获得熟练度，熟练度可以提升技能等级和伤害，技能熟练度达到要求会解锁更高级技能，所以我们要尽可能多的使用技能，把一个技能练到极致会比每个技能练一会要强得多！ 3.游戏的里控制技能对任何敌人都有效，但部分怪物被控制后会狂暴，狂暴状态下将免疫控制且伤害可能会略微提高。 4.按Q可以快捷保存。 5.设置里面有设置战斗加速，修改窗口样式等功能。 6.更换装备时镶嵌物品会自动转移到新装备上，不需要自己取下来重新镶嵌。 关于战斗： 与其他回合制战斗不同，游戏中有攻速属性。 攻速直接影响角色普通攻击造成伤害的次数，而普通攻击每次造成伤害恢复5点TP，物理系技能是没有冷却时间的只受TP点数的限制，所以攻速也间接的影响了技能的释放频率。 对于敏捷路线的角色，想要提升输出，提升敏捷和攻速是最佳方式。（前提是你的攻击不能太低） 对于力量和智力路线的角色，攻速带来的提升并不明显，所以TP恢复至关重要。很多时候直接增加伤害不如增加TP恢复来的实在！ 关于美术： 刚开始是有想请画师和美工的打算，可是了解了下价格我放弃了…… 整个游戏包括角色立绘、行走图、怪物图片、场景图块、技能特效、UI设计然后一堆图标感觉没个十来万下不来，这让我实在承受不住。 后来想找人已合作的方式给分成，但似乎也不现实，毕竟想找人来免费玩你的游戏都挺困难的…… 所以，只能咬咬牙自己瞎折腾了。游戏的UI素材大部分是RPG make和dlc自带的，也使用了部分其他资源，费劲力气也只能整成现在这样了！ 关于剧情： 作为一个rpg游戏剧情至关重要，但是很遗憾…… 我个人觉得游戏的剧情框架还是不错的，但是受限于自己的文笔和图片素材不足，很多剧情其实都是根据现有图片素材临时编的。 其实游戏中有很多东西没有讲，比如： 1.关于水斗的来历，其实佐克和水斗的父母其实曾经也是猎魔者，后来水斗父母意外死亡，于是佐克退隐照顾主角。 2.夜瞳的父亲其实是十几年前的被星玄打败的将军，整个军队全部战死无一生还。由于莫名其妙的被人团灭，他从受人尊敬的将军变成笑柄，夜瞳和母亲也饱受其他人的嘲笑，夜瞳的母亲也因此郁郁而终，所以长大后夜瞳来到帕拉斯是想弄清楚当年的事，为父亲正名。 3.乌诺斯为啥要打帕拉斯？其实是有人拱火，这个人和故事的幕后黑手麦迪文一样其实都来自的另一个大陆。他们就是想两边拱火，让两国打起来，他们就可以乘机进行实验，制造战斗用的魔物，说白了就是想把这片大陆当成战争实验室。 4.其实后续还有剧情，大致内容是：两国还是打起来了，之后再与夜瞳再见面，却不得不兵戎相见。然后会有新角色出现，阻止了战斗，新角色是另一个大陆的人，他正在调查他们那个大陆的一个邪恶组织，而这场战争就是这个邪恶组织在幕后操纵，目的是乘乱制造出可控制的魔物…… 其实整个剧情有点参考了一部日本动漫《大剑》，这是一部被禁的神作（个人觉得是神作！），至今我的电脑里还有这部动漫的资源，想看的可以加群@我，哈哈哈…… 后续： 虽然这个游戏还有后续剧情，但是暂时不打算出续作，因为我觉得自己目前还没有力能把剩下的故事讲好…… 也许等哪一天时机成熟了，我会回来继续填这个坑，也许…… 之后还是会接着做新的游戏，目前有一些思路，大致是一个策略经营+战棋的游戏。 新游戏的话打算用unity去做，也会花钱去请美工画师，有新进度我也会在群里通知大家，希望大家到时能关注一下。 游戏qq群：634019932 作者b站主页： 头条和西瓜视频：","['Simplified Chinese']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/header.jpg?t=1653818726","","","1245496327@qq.com",True,True,False,0,"",0,0,0,"",21,0,"",0,0,0,0,"水狗工作室","水狗工作室","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Free to Play,Indie,RPG","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_71debbd8b2ef0220362d2457c7d436a757452416.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_a55f7799378a715f1a09d0f1865b54f5cf331542.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_6e6dae23ecff4709935a9f7af04ae2043893b4ce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_212e0e0e54a3fb01bad00b29ce0742fa9a3a3823.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_5eee828bfaf061ec4aab893177b8517b2f43c421.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_274c26ce4b9d0b6ca184ae25f398f135e1872df5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_74317dd7bf08e20a494b4e2981993df2950b862b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888059/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369874,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888060/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369878,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256885323/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369883,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256885321/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369887"

304970,"SolidFace Parametric CAD Modeler 2D/3D","Dec 22, 2014","0 - 20000",0,0,0.0,0,0,"Part module SolidFace Sketch automatically creates parametric reference for modeling features that can be edited in a very simple and interactive way. This is an in-house developed module and fully integrated with the 3D module. SolidFace allows multiple bodies creation. A powerful tool helps in the development of dependent parts from a single part file. The parameterization allows not only an easy model editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners, automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association, such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material, information, text, etc. Assembly module Easy, accurate and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component. You can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly document; this is known as bottom-up assembling or if you need to construct a component that needs dimension references of some assembly components, you can create it, within the Assembly module. This operation is called in-context or top-down part creation. To facilitate the assembly process, the part elements can be enabled or disabled at any time without interfering the process of inserting (bottom-up) or creating (top-down) new components. Drawing module Besides the 2D draft capabilities explained in the SolidFace drawing product, you can also insert parts and assemblies into the drawing module in order to generate automatic orthographic, sections and details views. These views and dimensional annotations are created according to DIN and ANSI norms. Personalized by the designer. The 3D models views can be displayed in several model styles. The sections or details views are automatically created and aligned with the base view. Another advantage of the automatic link between the modules is the ability to copy and paste 2D geometric entities to the 3D Sketch module in order to use it as reference geometry to 3D features operations like extrude, revolve, etc. Exploded view An exploded view is a diagram, picture or technical drawing of an object, that shows the relationship or order of assembly of various parts. This allows the components (parts and sub-assemblies) to be visualized with defined displacements. The exploded view can be enabled or disabled at any time of the project creation. 3D Direct modeling Interact directly with the geometry of the model. Manipulate it by pushing, pulling, or twisting. Keeping the steps that create the final model, direct modelling allows the features geometry to be parametric modified by editing the feature used to create the new faces. 2D/3D Movement simulation One of the many capabilities of logical conditions is to enable the system to detect the collision of components assembly. The collision or the simulation process can be aborted and analyzed at any time. This makes possible not just a simple mechanism video demonstration but also a real-time movement simulation. The parameterization capability is one of the greatest advantages of SolidFace and it is present in all design steps. 3D Motion simulation is no different; the simulation is updated simultaneously with the movement. Another important capability is the simulation of 2D mechanisms, which can be performed either in 2D drawing or in 3D sketch module.

But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat. In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system. This game fits best for... - People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work - Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids - Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding - Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time’ (although we believe you shouldn’t feel guilty at all while playing games!) - Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun - Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it - People who like smart cats Learn how machine learning works in real life! The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required! Train yourself into a data science wizard! Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen. Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right? Improve your gear, improve your life! Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe! Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! while True: learn() is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!","['English', 'Russian', 'German', 'Hungarian', 'Korean', 'Greek', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Polish', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Czech', 'Japanese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Vietnamese']","[]","“WT:L has truly turned out to be a one-of-a-kind title.

392030,"Murasaki","May 12, 2016","0 - 20000",0,0,4.99,0,1,"A mystical world on the edge of destruction. Unlikely saviors joined by fate and duty. A mission driven by music, magic...and survival. Murasaki is a hybrid shmup and puzzle game that creates intense and high-speed gameplay against a serene landscape with gorgeous music. With the ability to only fire a single bullet at a time, you must use cunning, angles and timing to survive. Random shapes will appear as the levels progress: these designs will trigger massive explosions when shot. If you can bounce corresponding shapes off of each other, they'll create a chain reaction that, with a little luck, will wipe the screen. Don't wait too long, because the enemies will overwhelm you in a second! If you can't get a clear shot, each character has a special attack with limited uses. Use them wisely to get out of a tight situation or to put the finishing blow on one of several bosses! Characters Kairi The older of the heroes, Kairi acts as a big brother, though he's not related to Satsuki. His movements are slow, but his long range shot can reach anywhere on the screen, perfect for ricochet combinations. This however, also means that you don't have rapid shots. Kairi's special attack is a spiraling explosion that reaches most of the screen. This bomb can absorb enemy's bullets and destroy multiple targets. Use it wisely. Satsuki The younger hero, Satsuki is impetuous and headstrong, and it shows in her attack formation. Satsuki can move across the screen quickly, but the range of her shots is very short. Sometimes they won't reach the enemy. However, using her speedy shots, you can bounce the explosive blocks farther than Kairi, which makes it easier to create a chain attack with other blocks. Just be careful not to bounce them too far, or the explosion won't reach the enemy! Her special attack is a cross-formation energy wave. It hits harder than Kairi's, but could easily miss if the timing is off. Use it wisely. Find your center and get into a flowing rhythm of evading and exploding. If you can master the mechanics, Murasaki is insanely satisfying, mixing the mayhem and the tranquil music in a beautiful dissonant clash. Failure means death, swift and painful. Don't look at where the bullets in front of you go: plan for where the explosions will happen afterwards. There is a long and tragic story within Murasaki: each successful (and even unsuccessful) chapter unlocks new information, history, bios and even musical tracks. To truly understand the full game, you must become an expert with both Kairi AND Satsuki. It's daunting, it's hard, but the satisfaction of a full unlock is unmatched. Config You can start a config tool from 'Launch Configuration Tool' when you start the game. Here, you can configure the screen size, BGM/SE ratio, key bindings, etc. The death of an empire. The rise of darkness. And two heroes alone combat a broken soul.","['English', 'Japanese']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/header.jpg?t=1578972607","http://katatema.main.jp/mu/","","support@playism.jp",True,False,False,0,"",0,85,8,"",48,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Katatema","PLAYISM","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Bullet Hell,Shoot 'Em Up,Anime,Great Soundtrack,Puzzle,Singleplayer,Arcade,2D,Casual,Female Protagonist,Difficult,Fantasy,Controller,Retro,Atmospheric,Colorful,Experimental,Cute","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_4115d58f8cc9da6c994cab98521befed122d0118.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_285723e0ac3ed606a80f42215f7dc2729de3058e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_403dbdfb1fd4dc8c04b4ef9bd04ff3b20eecfc68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_c92a966fb2f34bebefafcf328657ae4aa0ce265e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_37412d3ee0e9b2bd10b0113f6be42778f40199c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_c7e0d85a7b1624ff9bead15a154ba9d45db55ec6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_42b64c0fd9cacdbc4aa84ce821cd7a0c5e5105f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_d007163a143881a64465a68f319e44ed509f635e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_fbec3bd2fcceadefa58f491ddecc3e2a97fa5f77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256662903/movie_max.mp4?t=1461316502,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660464/movie_max.mp4?t=1461316516"

Generally it manifested itself as recovery of motion functions and need for food. But in some cases scientsits found out that the creatures had totally independent behavior and strong desire to control and destroy all species around for their personal purposes. As soon as the military got informed of such qualities of zombie-genome, they immediately started to develop a new kind of biological weapon. After many experiments they finally made the first prototype of a biological weapon which had its own mind and shapeless jelly-like body. It had an ability to take control of any living creature. This weapon gave them an opportunityto resolve any conflict by force. But one day there was an emergency. One of the labs in Colony No4 went out of power just for a few seconds. It was enough for the young bioweapon to feel free and escape. In this game you will act like the young bioweapon. You will encounter lots of traps and puzzles. You will have to possess human bodies to pass the game to the end. Good luck! In this game you’ll find: - good old platforms - lots of action and tactics - simple, exciting and original gameplay - 54 levels full of deadly traps - unique main character - 5 characters for walking through a game - perfect pixel art style.","['English', 'Russian']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/header.jpg?t=1458860484","http://immortalgamestudio.com/","http://immortalgamestudio.com/support","support@immortalgamestudio.com",True,True,True,0,"",0,237,65,"",16,266,"",52,0,70,0,"Immortal Game Studio","Immortal Game Studio","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie","Indie,Action,Casual,Adventure,Platformer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_140a2fd6fb52ad0cc732ff1393ccd72fe06a4397.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_1fd7825a112733c871b5cf95060528217dd28551.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_01107b6fd7174ff7a0deda479ef1c109e2a061fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_95321c0b96b9993702fe7399303b3f64d622a356.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/441670/ss_53881d8e15fb21e3e7511b8016cc0ae9725652a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458860484","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660441/movie_max.mp4?t=1458371232"

No graphics, no menus, no point-and-click — you navigate a written story using typed commands, and read what happens next. Travel to the haunted coastal town of Anchorhead, Massachusetts and uncover the roots of a horrific conspiracy inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. Search through musty archives and tomes of esoteric lore; dodge hostile townsfolk; combat a generation-spanning evil that threatens your family and the entire world. A sprawling, meticulously detailed setting, brought to life by finely crafted prose and illustrated with dozens of spine-chilling illustrations, ensures that the story will stay with you long after you finish playing the game. A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder — fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones.

Beautiful and elegant 3D graphics offer panoramic views of 30 incredible levels in 5 amazing worlds. The game puts the player in the role of a marble, which is guided through a narrow winding course suspended in mid-air in five different worlds: Skyworld, Iceworld, Caveworld, Cloudworld and Lavaworld. The marble can be morphed into different balls with unique physical properties, like a Marble Ball, a Power Ball (which can be charged and have an accelerated 'dash', a 'jump' ability or switchable 'magnetism' properties), a Steel Ball (which can push heavy objects around), and so forth. Each course contains obstacles and traps, such as wooden blocks, sheets of cloth, spinning fans, magnets, and cannons. The game uses physics-based puzzles as well, such as moving boxes; also, different balls react to the environment in different ways; Steel Balls, for example, will tear cloth platforms. Each level is timed, and players are rewarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals, depending on how quickly they complete the level. Switchball has received several awards over the years and is now relaunched on Steam as Switchball HD. Originally called Crazy Ball, the game won 'Best PC Game' during the 2005 Swedish Game Awards and was a finalist in the 'Technical Excellence Class' during the 2006 Independent Games Festival. Switchball also won Team Xbox XBLA Game of the Year in 2007.

Our world is complex and unexplored. We mostly don't notice anything of all this thanks to secret organizations whose objective is the elimination of paranormal phenomena . In Beyond Senses, you'll slip into the role of either a good hunter or an evil demon. Discover the world Beyond our Senses! Countless features guarantee a varied and unforgettable gaming experience . Beyond Senses can be played by up to 5 players! Beyond Senses is one of those rare multiplayer horror games that offer more than just one game mode! Three game modes are currently available: HUNT , EGOIST and BANISHMENT . Each game mode can be customized to your personal needs. In HUNT , your task is to weaken the wandering creature by charging blessed Energy Crystals and killing it afterwards. The more energy the Crystals receive, the weaker the creature becomes after some time. If the creature is weakened enough, you can kill it with your weapons and send it back to hell! In EGOIST you compete against your fellow players. Your goal is to conquer as many Energy Crystals as possible. Whoever has conquered the fewest Energy Crystals after a certain time will be hunted mercilessly by the wandering creature. You can use a stun gun to put your fellow players out of action for a short time and gain a time advantage. In BANISHMENT you must find all the cursed items and place them properly in a pentagram . Once you have successfully completed the ritual, you must lure the wandering creature into the pentagram to send it back to hell! Evil is all around us. Each location is individually designed and can be played in any game mode . All players should have the opportunity to create the best possible gaming experience for themselves. For this reason, new locations are constantly being added . There are currently 3 different maps available: CEMETERY FOREST HORROR HOUSE If you play as a hunter, you can currently choose between 4 different characters: John Hughes , Lauren Williams , Elijah Knight and Amy King ! As a creature, you currently have the choice between Dr. Walker (ghost) and Valac (demon). Both hunters and monsters have different 'skins', which can change the appearance of the characters. These skins will be unlocked during the course of the game by gaining experience points . From time to time there will be bonus actions or contests in which special skins can be unlocked. More hunters, monsters and skins will be added during the development of the game! So that your gaming experience does not go unrewarded, there is a level system.

Through the lens of these rules, it seeks to answer a simple question: what makes a choice meaningful? Over 100 puzzles that are challenging due to the underlying ideas. Each puzzle is honed to its simplest form, so the difficulty comes from discovering the consequences of the mechanics rather than the size and complexity of the puzzles. Friendly design that wants you to understand. If you get stuck, each puzzle has a hint to point you in the right direction. Still stuck?

You will therefor need to destroy and gather enough Raw Metal components to buy new blocks ready to be used on your ship. Gamemodes Once you are ready to go, you will be able to choose from 2 gamemodes, whether that's team deathmatch or capture the ship is up to you. Team deathmatch game mode puts you head to head with another fleet of SpaceTek commanders, but be warned they could have defensive or weaponry blocks that could cause you serious damage. Your goal in team deathmatch is to destroy the enemies team relay station by doing so you stop there commanders from regenerating there ships. Capture the ship game mode will again put you head to head with enemy SpaceTek commanders but your task is to bring back enough disabled ships by tractoring them towards your relay station. Which ever fleet collects the most disabled ships wins the battle. Multiplayer Play alone in a artificial fleet, or team up with players in Online matches bringing all the deadly abilities with you to eliminate the enemy fleet Ship customisation By using your collected Raw Metal components, gather blocks to build a ship ready to face the enemy fleet.

A tool to quickly build Battle Maps (Interior &amp; Exterior) for Screen in Table, Print, or Digital Play. As a bonus feature you can play right inside the software using our hero and monster tokens. Play as if your Miniatures are in the map. In four quick steps you are ready to Battle: Choose a tile size Place Some Tiles Add Some Decoration Push Play! How Can You Use It? Screen in Table Play (As shown below) Projector on Table Play Print and Play (Orthographic Print Exports for you to print yourself or have printed professionally. [Vista Print sizes included]) Play in Digital Dungeon Tiles with our token system. (With New Token Stats System) What Are Some Features? Screen and Print-based Map Sizes are available and customizable. (Screenshot Below) Choose the size of your Screen in Table or Print Page. Build Battle Maps Export for Print Play right in Digital Dungeon Tiles Hero and Monster Tokens Time of Day Lighting Weather System Animated Effects Save and Load Maps (Including Token Locations) Mix Token and Miniatures based play to have Fog of War when using real Miniatures. NEW Token Stats System Note: This is a map making software first and foremost, the extra playing features included and being added are bonus content. Update v1.5- Token Stats System Token Stats is a visual stats system available on each token while in play mode. Stats can be hidden and shown as needed, on each token. This gives players access to quickly tracking HP and other important stats, to make playing easier. This works great with the token system and works with real miniatures by sitting tokens beneath them on the map. Token Name Current Hit Points Maximum Hit Points Actions Status Effects Facing Direction Token Ownership Update v1.7 - Dicey Dice (Filled Request) A simple Dice Roller allowing multiple dice to be rolled at the same time with each individual result being displayed. The dice display area can be cleared and closed to free-up screen space as needed. The dice roll from the view of the selected token, making dice results easy to read. Update v1.8 - Initiative System We've added an Initiative System to help track turns.. because even when playing with 3D printed miniatures, paper character sheets and real dice.. no one likes to track initiative! So let us track initiative for you! Give your tokens a unique name Click the 'add to Initiative' button Play! The tokens can mark their turn as done, delay until the end of the turn, be added and removed at any time. Clicking an image in the initiative bar pings the token on the map! (Tokens are also auto pinged at the start of their turns). And, you can also clear initiative and start fresh when ever you need. Extra Information Works with Hero Mini Maker *Not Required Works best with Miniatures created and printed from within Hero Mini Maker (shown in screenshots). /","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/header.jpg?t=1588468093","http://www.dragom.ca/digital-dungeon-tiles/","http://www.dragom.ca/digital-dungeon-tiles/","",True,False,False,0,"",0,3,5,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"HMM","Dragom","Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Remote Play Together","Adventure,Indie,RPG,Strategy","Indie,Strategy,Adventure,RPG,Level Editor","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_7fed34481db657631fbf2c662cc20496a54e44dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_4f02bcb8f36555c6ff5a4d90d22d2a5ed0e5093a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_6c51b08758ac68c1e652fa8e922f6583fc586f5c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_d663390437b0bfccbcd5cdf1c9068a2811f4f963.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_1aebff4b7d81b84142ef840bac15e0aedf407168.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_4b146e9607cfc0374005cc1cbcf18b9f16d5458a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_2de1d93747e0b0ffbc949aece2457ed2bcb5bc97.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_bb0628b220a69d9037e97c35d49643d3114cfd3c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_4149d057cf10f7a3f087a4262c833c1fca8c3a84.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_adf00971c4fb9d1074f308220894149bfa107d62.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_d263053c6a33ffe05236ecb7374802d1c24ecee7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1275970/ss_addd2834638fbf35c8fbc4f28558a2d030e56053.1920x1080.jpg?t=1588468093","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256779664/movie_max.mp4?t=1585599985"

1259000,"Damascus","May 15, 2020","50000 - 100000",4,0,0.0,0,0,"Damascus is set in a post apocalyptic fantasy future where the destruction of the past has knocked society into a medieval state of living. Many creatures have gained sentience in this timeline leading to the rise of frogman, catsons, owlpeople and many other races. Over time humans have developed psychic abilities that they can invoke with the use of mechanical psychic actuators, these psychic abilities allow them to summon fire or teleport to new locations among many other powers. The destruction of this world was caused by Dark Gods of sacrifice known as the Gods of Destruction, the player can sacrifice items to these entities in order to receive powerful boons from them. The apocalypse was thousands of years in the past and many of those living today have very little to no knowledge of the events that transpired or the fact that there even was an apocalypse. Design Goals Our goal is to create a MMO experience that rings true to how classic tabletop Dungeons and Dragons feels with weekly meetups where the dungeon master is creating new custom content for his players taking their decisions and desires into account. We want to have a very active community and will be working very hard to interact directly with the players of the game. We also want to implement new concepts like temporary bosses that drop limited edition items. Controls Left Click to perform the most obvious action on a given tile. Right click to bring out a drop-down menu of all possible actions for a given tile. Tab to show or hide the sidebar. FAQ Here is a little set of common questions about the game in a FAQ format. We thought this would be an easy way to get across a lot of information. How do you guys make money? We sell bonds which grant membership. The bonds are redeemable for 14 days of membership and can be traded with other players if you so desire. This means its feasible to do an in game activity for someone who has already bought a bond and trade them for the bond as payment for the activity as a means to become a member. What is membership? Membership is the full game experience and unlocks access to all of the in game skills and grants access to the entire game world. Money made from membership helps us cover the server costs and really helps us out! Will you ever sell experience or items directly? No we will not. The only thing we will sell are bonds. The value of a bond in game is determined by the players and what they are willing to trade for them. The only way to gain experience or items will be to play the game. We don't believe in selling power. What are your goals in terms of membership? Our biggest goal would be to get 500 monthly members which would allow us to cover all our server costs and both work on the game full time. Any members over this amount would be an absolute blessing! What happens when I die in game? All of your currently equipped and all items in your inventory will be dropped and you will re-spawn in Split City. Will you reimburse my items if I die and lose a lot of them? No we will not, dying in game and losing items is part of the game and it's up to you to bank important items you don't wish to lose. How many towns are there in game? There are 14 towns currently in the game. What happens if I forget my password? As long as you provided your email address when creating your account we can reset your password for you. At a later stage we will facilitate linking your Steam account to your Damascus account which will provide extra security and password retrieval mechanisms. Why aren't you guys doing Early Access? The way we view MMORPG's is that they are inherently a service. Our goal is to constantly update the game as long as it is live. Due to this we didn't want to be yet another permanently in early access game and have decided to have the first stable version of the game be our release version with many updates and future content already in the pipeline. How often will you update the game? We plan to update the game every couple of weeks with new content, however this is a loose timeline and it could be shorter or longer depending on the content we are currently working on. We intend to be very active on Discord so you can always ask us directly about what we are working on and approximately when you can expect the next update. Will you ever expand the world map? Yes we do plan to at some stage release new Islands and Continents which will expand the scope and scale of the game. However these updates will take some time to implement and most likely come with new quests as some of our larger updates to the game. Will I get banned for selling in game items for cash to my friends? No you won't. All in game items earned by you belong to you and you a responsible for them, this means you are free to give them away or sell them to other people and it also means that it's your responsibility to not lose your items in silly ways (like attacking a Damascus Steel Dragon at a low level). Will I get banned for using/creating a third party client? We won't be supporting third party clients and we would consider this a bannable offense. The only version of the client one should use is the Steam version. Will I get banned for macroing or botting? Macros that make the game easier as well as botting are not in the spirit of the game and are considered a bannable offense. We suggest avoiding macroing entirely.","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/header.jpg?t=1589537110","https://discord.gg/CVDFAv4","https://discord.gg/CVDFAv4","teamtealdom@gmail.com",True,True,True,0,"",0,189,54,"",25,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Team Teal","Team Teal","Multi-player,MMO,Steam Achievements,In-App Purchases","Free to Play,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,RPG","Massively Multiplayer,Free to Play,RPG,Indie,Pixel Graphics,2D,Economy,MMORPG","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_09ae0a664bd80b26283a7fabf2b0572069068e58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_044c318d309fb5e2bdaf32842f9ee773a36d6627.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_9c4f009fbd63ea54bdccc2ca342e7344c61fd243.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_d333e7c8266d694426319988a7fadbe9df20b1f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_f4325752b5e755b354f73f6e00cda6f2945ff75c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_b7ea377efb198b58379ba7a4c16f58c7ece6c3ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_6553664497359546092e15afd602e4413ec31e08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_f0eb87b1532976f4c014ab6f9d07ba96ec2f4544.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_2eaa11488ab7f6b93fd69bd82c9b3fc73fd347e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_add4765877132c3a24256663c336106057eca96b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_bf3ed00c288f58eb46c693962e511a9a13a108b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_7b472d940d552898377e868a017c082d6570786c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256782449/movie_max.mp4?t=1587378324"

Originally released in a non-Steam version around April of 2013. Please note that our second game, Boo Bunny Plague, already received the Greenlight in mid-2014 and has been on Steam. We are currently hard at work on our third game. STORY: It all started in Nordic Cove, a small hamlet in the fictional state we all know today as “New York”. Once called New Hamburgerstand in the early A.D. years, it flourished with fur trades and Bacon Cheeseburgers. It was also home to the gravesite of a crusty, sorcerous, evil-naughty-person; the Viking warlord “Helfdane the Terrible!” Helfdane’s tyranny of the New Land was halted during these very rough times due to bad planning, and terrible hygiene. Today, Bacon Cheeseburgers are still at an all-time high, and New North America is on the verge of being historically ♥♥♥♥♥-slapped. An archaeologist cork-sniffer named Dr. Howard Bre, and his lovely assistant, Kayte Sparo have disturbed this ancient gravesite. Thus, fulfilling a curse which reanimated Helfdane and his minions to rip the life force from beings starting with Nordic Cove! Holy crap! Kayte’s boyfriend, Paulie Chops, must find the help he needs to turn this around, stat! This is their date night after all. Don’t act like you’ve not had a night like this. Alright! YOU deal with that Helfdane thing. We’re getting Bacon Cheeseburgers and staying warm. We’ll be cheering for you! GAMEPLAY: The Curse of the Nordic Cove is a game, by gamers, for gamers. There are familiar elements of gameplay for all gaming fans from First Person Shooter, Sports, Puzzle-Solving, to Driving, Strategic Shooting and Stealth and Dungeon Crawling. This and more thrown at you, the player, in an eccentric and thrilling Survival-Horror game like no other. Using your choice of controls being Keyboard/Mouse combo or Gamepad, you maneuver the various characters through each level to complete a task and survive. All along the way, each character you control encounters enemies of various forms that will not hesitate to attack. There are obstacles that you need to figure out how to overcome.

I saw it on the PAX East show floor last weekend and thought it was so bizarre, I had to tape it.” Jason Schrier - Kotaku “The Curse of Nordic Cove is a very unique title set in a world unlike anything you’ve probably seen or played before. Combining your golf (yes, golf) skills with your surely honed FPS talents to create a title that is borderline insanity…in a good way! When I asked the creator of how this odd combo of golf/FPS came about, he told me he was hitting the links and had a simple thought- “What if Vikings invaded the course right now?” Yeah, I was sold after hearing that too.” Curtis Stone - Front Towards Gamer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/header.jpg?t=1572317067","http://onthelevelgames.com/","http://onthelevelgames.com/support/","http://onthelevelgames.com/contact/",True,False,False,0,"",0,15,15,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"On The Level Game Studios","On The Level Game Studios","Single-player,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,Indie","Action,Indie,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_75bdcb063135beb0acdb144572289afd7eda7ab2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_4029bb09c1d21949d7ba98505b390c82d2dd3ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_61fbbcd77f0a2f0706bec5083e6d906373211b5f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_e32f25b7fdbbfef41f7baa90e1ca501980009d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_eb778892bb0737056a86f64de46200b0e9190824.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_661a013dc431c6c9443792d95d265b38c88a1e15.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_497ca73a2f0ace5668d955cb3db5ed12c921fdc3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_9d7949a509f30e772d11ce6101616f33a19d4a99.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2038269/movie_max.mp4?t=1447372141,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2038292/movie_max.mp4?t=1447372242"

Hunt for unimaginable riches and fight intense battles in the unforgiving jungle. In this turn based strategy RPG, a cunning plan is as vital as thoughtful resource management. Expeditions: Conquistador offers a rich storyline separated into two campaigns, challenging players throughout 25+ hours of gameplay. Strategy veterans as well as newbies will find their turn-based El Dorado! Features Discover the New World! Travel to legendary locations in America, roam the jungle on the hunt for mystical temples as well as ancient ruins. Create your own party of followers! Choose from more than 30 characters, train your recruits and lead them to battle. Coach them as they will develop from untrained recruits to fierce battlefield veterans. Four highly customisable difficulty levels will challenge pros and newbies alike. But be warned: The Iron Man mode is a real beast! Choice &amp; Consequence: Use your skills to avoid hostility or, when diplomacy breaks down, adapt your tactics to highly varied terrains across more than 70 battlefields. Challenge your friends to tactical PvP combat in either Hot Seat mode or via TCP/ICP.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Italian', 'German', 'Russian']","['English', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Italian', 'Russian']","'The emotional investment in the game and its characters is impressive and the exceptional writing reinforces the connection to the world.' 8/10 – -expeditions-conquistador 'For me personally, this is one of the best and most unique games that I’ve played this year.' 9/10 - Hooked Gamers 'Expeditions: Conquistador is an entertaining and immersive experience from start to finish.' 9/10 - -conquistadors-review-heaps-of-historical-enjoyment/ 'Expeditions: Conquistador delivers a solid and engaging experience.'

Magic is your only defence against monsters, demons, beasts and occasionally even your neighbours. You live in a small cottage, far from the cutthroat madness where you’ll need to use your magical skills in your fight to stay alive. For now, you will visit the town, Baile An Dagda, meet other Draoi, learn new spells and venture on through the dangerous realms in An Domhan. Compete against other Draoi, practice your skills and earn both respect and fear. In our world, you can: Cast spells by carving them in the air with your bare hands. Spells are more powerful for the Draoi that can cast them with the precision and flair of only the mightiest practitioners. If you were born to do this, your enemies will know it. Experience the power as you summon elemental forces and unleash destruction on your enemies, heal your allies and protect what is yours (nothing better than flying into a battle and spewing a firestorm over your enemies before blasting them off to the horizon with a wave of your hand, hot, smoking and really quite upset) Enter dangerous battleground arenas, set in the raw landscape of An Domhan, where teams compete to vanquish (and ultimately humiliate) teams of lesser Draoi. Talk to those around you or coordinate with your team as you explore and battle. Show off your command of magic while you explore the beauty of Domhan to practice, fly, duel, conjure objects, create adhoc games with other Draoi and revel in the sensation of fluid magical power. This is no game. Fight to survive. Become the best. Stay alive. Win.

Nevermind ’s goal is to create an unforgettable gameplay experience that can help teach you to be more aware of your unique internal responses to stressful situations. If you can learn to control your feelings of stress and anxiety within the disturbing realm of Nevermind , just imagine what you can do when faced with those inevitable stressful moments in the real world… A one-of-a-kind atmospheric terror game that can sense your feelings of fear—creating an experience unlike anything you've played before.

This game is a sequel of the original classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It’s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting deer, you're hunting dinosaurs. You’ll visit huge, beautifully rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems. There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some of the more vicious dinosaurs. Choose between a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your hunting adventure. There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others will become enraged and attack. During your adventure you'll experience everything from 'pea-brained' dummies to cunning dinosaurs, with heightened senses of sight, hearing and smell. So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted. key Features: Hunt the largest and most ferocious animals known to man – the Dinosaurs! Huge 3D Free-Roaming Open worlds. Beautiful and realistic high definition graphics. A multitude of different Dinosaurs, from Herbivorous (plant eating) to the Carnivorous (meat Eating). Realistic AI – Dinosaurs react to sight, sound and smell, each with their own mannerisms and Behaviors. Explore and hunt in different Eco-systems including jungles, forests, beaches and rolling Hills. Equip camouflage and Cover Scent to even the odds. A variety of weapons and equipment to choose from (from Sniper Rifle to Cross-bow). Map and Radar to locate and track Dinosaurs. Use tranquilizer darts instead of bullets (experience the thrill of the hunt without the killing).

What has happened in this place, where the people are gone and their memories echo in the silence? Where emotions appear as physical things, hanging in the air, just waiting for someone to reach out… Empathy: Path of Whispers is an atmospheric and story-driven adventure game where you explore a seemingly abandoned world through the emotions and memories of the people who once inhabited it, trying to restore the world’s lost balance as you journey through its past. With a strong focus on storytelling and exploration, players will find themselves in a surreal world created from people’s emotions and memories, which can be manipulated and explored. Those lost memories are the key to rebuilding the crumbling world back to its former state, discovering its mysterious past and halting an impending apocalypse. Through its innovative narrative mechanics the game will challenge the player to explore and gain an understanding of the weird world they are traveling through. Game Features: Discover and explore other peoples’ memories in order to change the world around you, solve puzzles and access new areas. Traverse a strange world and uncover what triggered the silent apocalypse. Follow a narrative as it develops, interwoven with your exploration. Experience the story through multiple first person perspectives and use your wits to piece the events together.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian']","['English', 'Russian']","“A title you should definitely play if you enjoy puzzles and enjoy a good story that is not spelled out for you.” 80/100 – 366GameReviews “I found Empathy: Path of Whispers to be incredible.” 80/100 – OPNoobs “The story might be the most interesting one I have encountered in the genre” 95/100 – The Inner Circle","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/header.jpg?t=1599049247","","http://empathygame.org/","contact@empathygame.org",True,False,False,59,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/empathy-path-of-whispers?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,110,69,"",13,133,"",32,0,32,0,"Pixel Night","Iceberg Interactive","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie","Adventure,Indie,Walking Simulator,Story Rich,Great Soundtrack,Atmospheric,Puzzle,First-Person,Mystery","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_edcaba4a122c02ec43fcf060db3db5d60dc0cd17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_1c59a5d61c18bf109bef86cd6bf146798f8865cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_5e57b3c71f7eff0c142d746021d4d74cbf889686.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_4faba51d7954fbfaeabc62b8a3185cd1ba80791d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_4d8faa8ff0e5cc8e534d1626343c72b5844d2607.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_aa0b866178eda12b77958a0432c0b2ca7c7de265.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_980b365ef0aecb5602437e98a9ce11c59387678b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_d35115b4395dceb84cefdc17f08cd511f0d78238.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291690/ss_5167e1c355ca36b4a852bec0f275b1d968fc8ad5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599049247","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256684280/movie_max.mp4?t=1493817371,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256669882/movie_max.mp4?t=1472603304"

Animations and particle effects, tokens, and audio files can be used to immerse your players. It's a player, not a 3d map-building software. Both the demo and the full version contain only a few simple battle grids, so you will need the videos or static battle maps of Dynamic Dungeons or other creators. This software is in constant development, future updates will be free. Import Dynamic Dungeons maps or your own images or video files into the storyline and make a playlist, cover and reveal areas with the fog of war tool, apply custom size hex or quad grid overlay. Playing on the Tv screen is easier than you think. Simply lay flat your TV. You can protect the screen with a cheap plexiglass sheet, and use dry or wet-erase markers on it, so miniatures and dice rolls won't damage the surface of the Tv. You can also project down the video onto a physical table with an HD projector. Please note, that it's not a VTT for online gaming. The Dynamic Dungeons Editor will help you to adjust the color of the videos and static maps, import png tokens to represent the players and their foes. You can play various ambient sounds and use particle effects to pimp up static or animated maps. A free modular dungeon pack is available for this software containing more than 100 png props like corridors and various chambers to build your own dungeon. (Although there are many customization options available and custom 2D maps can be created with the application, be aware that Dynamic Dungeons maps are not made with this app, but in various 3D software. You may want to try the demo version before you buy.)","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/header.jpg?t=1646316909","https://dynamicdungeons.com/","https://patreon.com/dynamicdungeons","dynamicdungeons@gmail.com",True,True,False,0,"",0,55,19,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Dynamic Dungeons","Dynamic Dungeons","Single-player,Includes level editor","RPG,Early Access","RPG,Software,Utilities,Top-Down,Fantasy,Tabletop,Animation & Modeling,Board Game,Mystery Dungeon,Early Access,Choose Your Own Adventure,Family Friendly,Local Multiplayer,3D,Gaming","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_7a743f9cadebe35de2f11333b35f51a03ccc255d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_1a9a95374b0755e82c15525d9cdd87d6966df574.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_e27c92e30b95d22c2609837983367efa701e8198.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_9deeb8a0f91106334cc3f0791bbd2f3b5d82ca4a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_f483731e6f37dde51629d99d82df840583b6700e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256848447/movie_max.mp4?t=1634111017"

A medieval metropolis that went bonkers after the people discovered goop - a raw fluid that provided energy, skin cream, bread spread and powered diesel engines. And it turned the people of Ravensdale into raging, bloodthirsty monsters. Lucky for them they have you, leading a pack of lunatic knights on a killing spree to save the city. Gameplay Rogue Stormers combines classic run ‘n’ gun gameplay with a modern art style, twin stick shooter configuration and all the good things rogue like has to offer. Did we mention that you can have up to three friends join you on your rampage in either online or couch co-op mode? Your goal is to fight and beat the ultimate evil threatening Ravensdale - but in order to beat him, you need to fight your way through 7 increasingly challenging levels. If you die, you'll be back at square one. Earned perks are yours to keep, allowing your character to grow stronger with each new raid. Our technology enables us to layer and combine level chunks to create meaningful level combinations with infinite replayability. An ever-growing cast of enemies, hazards and loot is layered within each chunk, generating incredible diversity. Tons of different upgrades and weapons will cause each new session to play in a unique fashion, depending on which weapons or upgrades you pick and get. Adding to that are five unlockable character classes, each with its own skills and base weapon. The further you delve into the vast undercity of Ravensdale, the more you will learn about the city's history and that of its citizens, as well as the tragic backgrounds of the five heroes who took arms to save the city. All these factors combined determine how you’ll engage the sprawling city of Ravensdale. Will you go toe to toe with your enemies or pick them off them from a distance?

Some themes and contents might be more suitable to mature audiences. Story The Heart Breachers is an organization committed to keep humankind safe from the harmful manifestations of their own emotions. Contained within every burst of feelings is an Ignite, the purest form of energy. Negative feelings bear Lingerings, and positive feelings produce Astrays. Astrays are typically tame, but Lingerings could wreak havoc in the real life while driving its host to madness. However these projected forms pale in comparison to the Ignites. Often unruly and violent, killing an Ignite means killing its host’s ability to feel emotions permanently. It is your job to tame the beasts within human hearts.

1213420,"Texas Holdem Poker: Solo King","Mar 4, 2020","0 - 20000",0,0,12.99,0,0,"The game consists of two parts: 1: In the console game section, you can play tournament games and heads-up games against professional-level AI opponents. 2: A complete set of Texas Hold'em calculation tools The table below shows the functional price comparison between the computing tools in the game and other Texas-related computing products on the market. Help players solve two problems: 1: Have a complete tool chain: You have purchased a complete set of Texas Hold'em calculation-related tools at a very cheap price, and it calculates correctly and runs stably. It is cheap, comprehensive, and convenient. One account can share data on multiple platforms, and the functions are consistent, and there is no castration. 2: Learn the playing strategies of professional poker players: You only play games with professional-level AI and learn the playing strategies of professional poker players. There is no random behavior to confuse you with entertaining AI, and I don't want to waste your time. Satisfy player pursuit and advancement: 1: When players play Texas Hold'em, they just want to find and master a set of playing strategies that suit their profession. The professional AI I wrote is written in accordance with the standard textbook-style playing strategies of professional poker players, and they are all in standard poker scenarios. fixed action paradigm, It is very fixed, not random, which helps you quickly understand the playing strategies of professional players. to learn this strategy. Your discovery and learning of patterns will not be interfered with by random strategies. Don't think it's going to be silly, it plays a lot better than most players in online real money games. You can buy it on steam to try its AI capabilities, if you are not satisfied, you will get an unconditional refund within 2 hours, you have nothing to lose at all. This AI uses standard and mature textbook play to fight against you. You can learn the AI's play, understand the AI's play, and find your own way of defeating the AI. It all depends on your own understanding and ability. The AI ​​is not responsible for providing you with the thrill of victory, it is up to you to win. The more games you play in the world of online real money gaming, the more severely you feel you are bound, you feel right, you are almost all playing with a group of professional players who rely on a full suite of scientific tools to give real-time calculations and decision-making cues playing. It was people who were heavily armed like me. In fact, the AI ​​strategy in this game basically covers all my action strategy logic. I wrote it to greatly reduce the energy consumption of my decision-making in the poker game. The strategies in this game are extremely effective at PokerStars blind levels below $10/$20. Further up, I don't want to play games with too much stake, so I can't stand up effectively, so I don't level up. 2): You have learned strategies, and you need a complete set of tools to assist you. Without scientific calculation tools, in real money poker games, you have strategies and dare not use them. The essence of Texas Hold'em is a real mathematical probability game. Data and calculations determine the choice of strategies. In the past two years, the Texas Hold'em books handwritten by foreign professional players who have been translated by the player groups on Taobao are very expensive, far more expensive than my game. Those books cost hundreds of yuan, and they are still very popular. This marks that although the state strictly prohibits Texas games, players' pursuit of strategic knowledge has not stopped. They provided some foreign poker experience and strategies, and I provided a professional training ground and toolset that also filled the gaps for the Chinese in terms of Texas science tools. 3): Optics does not practice, it is natural to learn, and it is valuable to apply what you have learned. You don’t know whether you are cheating or not, and you don’t know why you win or lose. Basically, you are just playing for nothing. In this game, you can freely organize the table, freely set the blind level, freely set the hand range of each opponent, freely set the opponent's AI type, and freely set your own hand range, so that every time the card is dealt, the You're dealt hands in this range, and you're also free to set one of the 20 good hands, so there's a definite training. In the game, the various win rate data, listening win rate, and EV data of each player on each street are calculated in real time, saving you the trouble of manual calculation, and also giving you AI decision-making suggestions from professional-level textbooks. These ensure that you can train fully on demand. and judging whether it makes sense for you. The complete display of this information in the game also helps you analyze the game, so that you know the logic of your winning and losing, where you win and where you lose. Don't think that you lost, it was me who cheated, you can understand whether I cheated by reading the data and graphs carefully, you can't understand these, either you have no knowledge of technology and playing cards, or your understanding is too poor, what? It's all clear, you still can't understand it, and it's clear that you don't have the ability to think, and you can't play IQ games, so don't waste time torturing yourself. Tell you clearly: 1: I sell strategies and tools, and I show you professional strategies in the game. 2: The game is sold at a fixed price. Even if you lose all the chips and diamonds, the server will continue to supply chips and diamonds for you to play. There will be no extra charge. I don't need to cheat you for chips and diamonds at all. , I don't even bother with it. 3: The chips and diamonds provided are enough for you to play 50000 hands. You need about 500 hours to play them all. For the vast majority of players, they will not spend 500 hours on a certain game. They do not give you a huge amount. The chips and diamonds are also to bring you closer to the real world to play from small stacks, so that it makes sense. 4: It is not a multiplayer online crowd gambling game, but a console game, or more precisely, a training tool. The networking function ensures that you can freely share usage data between your mobile phone and computer. This game is more precisely a training tool and a tool for assisting actual combat calculation and strategy. I have provided you with a trainer aircraft and a fighter jet, and it is up to you to combine your wisdom, ability and financial resources to control and use it to assist you. If you think you want to train yourself and experience the brutality of professional gambling, then you can play hard. It provides you with the basic prerequisite knowledge, skill-strategy mix, training environment and toolsets you need from beginner to pro. As a poker tool, the existing functions have completely covered the calculation and decision-making functions of the whole process and all stages required for scientific training and real-time battles. At least it's completely enough for me. There is no longer any free on mobile: 1: Before the V4 version, a free google play version was provided for the convenience of steam players to download the mobile version for free, and for some users who were unwilling to pay to experience the function for free. The new version of V4 will be forced to upgrade from the beginning, and the old mobile phone version will not be able to log in. Old users who pay for it need to ask me for it. 2: Now I don't offer any free versions on all platforms. Now the computer and mobile phones have the same functions, and the google play also has the same price on steam. But you only need to buy the steam version, then you can send me a letter to ask for the corresponding android mobile version. When asking for the android version, you need to provide a screenshot of your purchase history on the steam platform to prove it. Just send me a screenshot of the purchase record information in the email. 3: All versions are unified as paid versions, and the price is the same, which ensures the rights and interests of paying players and the quality level of players. 4: On February 26, 2022, the new version of the server was updated to Alibaba Cloud, with 4 cores of 8G, 10M dedicated bandwidth, 80G cloud disk, and a 3-year lease, so the service for at least the next three years is guaranteed. If you are a streamer and have some fans, you are willing to play it, and willing to share and show this game to your fans, I am willing to provide you with some steam keys. Send me a letter with your platform and number of followers hits: In the battle mode, the range of each player is also shown to you graphically, and the player's hole cards are in the corresponding range. In the pc version, you can select a large resolution in the setting function, so that you can see the range map well in the game. And the most important thing is that it's the cheapest of its kind. manual： We welcome capable agent wholesalers from all over the world to sell the software, I provide retail steam keys in all regions of the world 100~500 steam keys, 30% off 500~1000 steam keys, 40% off 1000~2000 steam keys, 50% off The larger the wholesale quantity, the better the discount {LINK REMOVED} core function: 1: Click the function board card to set the community card, and click the hole card icon to set the hole card. 2: Different player types can be set, and each player has a different range of actions. These ranges also determine different action logics. 3: Equity calculator, draw equity calculator, EV calculator, real-time poker simulator tool. 4: Real-time poker simulator tool, this is the most important for online professional players, which greatly simplifies the time consumption of thinking and performing calculations. 5: Advisor (advisor) provides you with a standard play, the basic guarantee is not to lose money. 6: Before the action decision, provide the EV value of different actions and betsize. 7: Practice the advisor and action EV in the battle mode. Core value points: 1: Poker simulator tool: When playing poker online, professional players can display the complete mathematical data immediately after entering the opponent's range in real time according to the situation of the game table, saving users calculation time and energy, and providing standardized behavior suggestions. These real-time and accurate calculation data and standardized action suggestions help players make quick decisions. Value point: It saves the player's energy consumption in mathematical calculations in the game, and allows the player to invest more energy to focus on the accurate determination of the player's playing range and the use of real-time data to make decisions based on experience. Real-time display of all poker game data, which is not available in other tools. I combined the various data calculation functions scattered in multiple Texas poker calculation software into the real game. The player only needs to determine the opponent's range. In the simulator, Preflop and postflop are also purchased professional range action data, which can be set in the simulator: stacks deep, bet size, and player position to see the real-time advisor. Now this advisor is conservative. range data comes from rangeconverter.com/solution_formats/eight_max-MTT-Complete-Postflop-Addon-NEWOnlineViewer-yearly The core of the simulator is that you need to have the ability to judge the opponent's range of action. This is also one of the most basic and most important abilities of playing cards. If you don’t have the ability to display the range of Texas Hold'em at all, then you can use this tool to repeatedly play poker to familiarize yourself with the range. In the battle mode I provide the ability to display the range in real time. Let you clearly see how different people in different ranges play, and those actions are standard textbook play styles for professional players. Real-time display of complete data: The data standard provided comes from the result of 10,000 times Equity calculated by Monte Carlo method. In the battle mode with AI, you need to turn on the observer mode switch (observer) Data in the avatar frame: 1): EV: 0.70BB, indicating the EV data after the current operation. BB stands for the big blind value. 2): equity data for each street: 2r: 4; 12.93%. Format: 2r (to river equity, calculated to river street Equity): rank (in the current surviving players, own 2r Equity ranked); equity (own real-time 2r Equity, 2r Equity calculated from your own perspective). Indicates that the Equity data to River Street is calculated based on the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. nd: 1; 72.67%. Format: nd (next street equity, your own Equity on the next street): rank (ranked your own nd Equity among the current surviving players); equity (your own real-time nd Equity, nd Equity calculated from your own perspective). Indicates that the nd Equity data to the next street is calculated according to the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. cp: 1; 88.23%. cp (current street pure equity, the pure Equity of one's current street): rank (ranked of one's own cp Equity among the current surviving players); equity (your own real-time cp Equity, cp Equity calculated from your own perspective). Represents the calculated cp Equity data on the current street based on the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. Outs: 30, which indicates the number of draws made by players on that street. At this time, you can open the hands card strength information table, and you can see the probability of the current hole cards and board cards developing to various draws on each street. 1: In preflop and river street, showing 2r is enough. 2: On flop, turn street: displays the complete 2r, nd, cp data, and on flop, turn street, you can see the outs data of the player in that street at the same time. These real-time Equitys and draw data assist in determining the hole cards against other players' hole cards or ranges, their own hands card strength and winning ability, and help them make action decisions on various streets. The betsize window at the top of the interface shows the human player (self) under the current action menu, the EV value ranking of each action in the action menu, the leftmost is the best, and it decreases from left to right (if there is only the leftmost data, then it is According to EV evaluation, this action is the most appropriate, and other actions do not need to be considered). This is based on the action logic shown by the EV. This is also the EV data of each action calculated by the player himself before the action. (The EV data in the avatar range is the EV data after the action, and the meaning of the two is different). This 4-speed EV table of betsize is the data display for making decisions based on EV when displaying the street. In fact, EV has no absolute correct meaning in action guidance before and after the flop (preflop and postflop), and it is not correct to make decisions based on the positive and negative EV. Advisor (Advisor): Shows the decision in this street, comprehensively assessing the following content: player's hole cards, opponents' range or hole cards, current own 2r, nd, cp Equity data and Equity ranked, and the player's own position Table position, player's current stacks deep, current number of people remaining at the table, EV data of each action in the current menu, and bankroll management. The current advisors tend to be conservative, and the goal is to try not to lose money. Advisor also implements a standardized pre-flop strategy in preflop. Advisor also implemented the post-flop strategy suggested by rangeconverter.com in postflop. In the battle against AI mode, you need to turn on the advisor mode switch (observer). Click on the user's avatar to open the user's scope, view or set the scope. Click on the hole cards, you can open to view or set the hole cards. Click on the board card, you can open to view or set the board card. In the simulator, click the D icon to switch the position of the dealer. Click the gray D icon to reset the position of the dealer. Regarding range setting or selection: 1: Provides the standard range for various filling actions in the preflop stage. 2: Provide 24 kinds of action ranges commonly used by professional players. Each professional player divides all hole card combinations into 10 action groups. You can see the action ranges of tag, lag, rock, maniac, and nit players. 3: Provides a view of the opponent's mathematical action range based on the opponent's vpip and pfr. Vpip and pfr can view these two values ​​of opponents from third-party statistical software licensed online, such as holdem manager 2. The graphical Equity calculator provides a complete and correct Equity calculation function. I provide complete toflop, toturn, toriver's montecarlo and Enum calculation methods. It has the same effect as Power-Equilab, and its own data is guaranteed to be correct. When Power-Equilab calculates toflop and toturn, the data is often incorrect (why it is not, you will know by playing with his montecarlo and Enum methods, the longer the calculation, the greater the deviation of the two data, which is wrong), But the calculation result of to river is correct. It sells for $40/year. It does not have a real-time calculation method in the game. It is not suitable for actual combat, but only for review calculations, lacking actual combat significance. PokerGenius: This provides draw data, and my draw ability calculation is the same as his. This one is from the University of Alberta in Canada, which is also one of the two most famous schools in the world that studies AI in Texas, and the other is cmu. It also provides equity calculations, but only with toriver capabilities. Moreover, neither the draw calculation nor the Equity calculation has the ability of real-time calculation in actual combat. You can only manually enter the calculation to see the result in the review. It sells for $70. The provided Equity calculator, draw calculator, and EV calculator are all to ensure that you know the correctness of the data calculation results and allow you to trust the correctness and stability of the function. The AI ​​in the battle mode comes from the range of 24 professional players. You can conduct targeted range confrontation strategy training. 1): Various AIs and advisors use the same standard professional gameplay action logic. The difference from yours is only the hole cards and the action range. 2): 14 types of chip depths (10BB~100BB, 200BB) are provided (different medals will open different new chip depths, and different chip depths will have different playing methods). Because of the different chip depths, the card game will be played The strategy is completely different. 3): AI adopts the textbook style of professional players. You can understand the AI's action logic in thousands of matches, you can learn this action logic, and you can also find the corresponding exploiting AI logic. Repeated training can help you quickly identify the opponent's ability and the opponent's range. The functions of this V4 version basically cover the core functions in Snowie. As for the effect, you just need to compare it. I can only tell you the value for money. Ability matching is equivalent to Snowie 230 USD/year.

868060,"Immortal Darkness: Curse of The Pale King","Oct 17, 2018","0 - 20000",0,0,7.99,0,0,"Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics, slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself. Fools Rush In This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time. The Thirst As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many. Items are Everything With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play and what you can do. Secrets Within Secrets Few will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon. Evil has been at work here since ancient antiquity and there is more concealed in this place of eternal gloom than anywhere else in Uuld. Decisions that Will Shape the Cosmos There are many factions at play here and who you decide to ally with and who you decide to oppose has the power to dramatically reshape your story and the fate of this world, and possibly many others.","['English']","['English']","“...

To the sound of a mixture of unique musical genres, complete missions, improve your ship, be precise in your shots. All of this without worrying about GAME OVER! Play alone, in cooperative mode or challenge a friend in PVP mode, here competition is what counts! Regardless of how you choose to play, the fun has no limits! - Game Details: Inspired by a space theme and with touches of “Tron” (we love this movie!) The game is focused on fun and competition accompanied by frantic songs. Don't you like to die again and again? Then your problems are over! In 'Geometric Feel The Beats' you don't have to worry about that, you have fun doing the missions and collect points. Accumulating ranking points is not just for you to show others your ranking, they are also for buying upgrades for your spaceship. Using ranking points can make you drop some rankings, so analyze the timing of the purchase well, but buying upgrades makes your life easier in the game. Here you decide! Stay tuned to the Power up’s that appear in the stage, they are accompanied by big surprises! Game Modes: Adventure: Perfect for “lone wolves”, in this mode each stage is made up of two missions. You will have fun discovering new “AIs” and finding ways to overcome them. Co-op: In cooperative mode you start from scratch again. It does not take into account your advancement, upgrades or adventure mode ranking, but there is a crucial difference ... YOU WILL NOT BE ALONE! A friend will accompany you, helping you in the challenges of adventure mode, because everything is more fun with a friend! In this mode we have an exclusive ranking for players and their friends and the rules for purchasing upgrades remain the same. With teamwork you have achieved scores never imagined before! PVP: Who doesn't like to compete against a friend? In this mode, hitting your opponent gives you an advantage, he will be paralyzed for a few seconds while you complete your mission! There will be three missions per game, the one who wins the most missions wins. The rules remain the same as for adventure and the mission is the same for both players. Who will win this duel? – Ranking Who will remain at the top? Who will be the fastest and most accurate player? These questions will be answered here! There will be two classifications, one for adventure mode and one for cooperative. In advance, we warn you that the more you miss, the more points you will lose, which could cause the ranking to drop. - Steam Community: Between one explosion and another, we would like to see your most fun moments during the game. We love to see those moments! We encourage you to take prints and post them in our community. Be sure to tell us what you think of the game.

You step into the shoes of a hapless professional driver tasked with transporting various alcoholic beverages such as beer, spirits, wine and brandy to certain venues like birthdays and other miscellaneous celebrations. If you thought this mission will be easy, think again. The infrastructure will be challenging to say the least. Country roads, mountains and highways that resemble dirt roads will all prove to be worthy adversaries on your path towards a successful delivery. Abysmal roads aside, the biggest enemy will be your very own addiction to the booze you’re transporting. Potholes seem harmless after you’ve transformed into an insatiable drunkard which suddenly thinks that he’s got the off-road skills to take as many shortcuts as needed. The most inaccessible corners of the map no longer seem like obstacles. Really, what are YOU waiting for? Rev that engine, empty a couple of bottles and put your own skills to the test in a parody that absolutely does not encourage drunk driving in real life.

454330,"A Room Beyond","Jun 13, 2017","0 - 20000",0,0,7.99,0,0,"A ROOM BEYOND, is fantasy point and click adventure based on essential subjects of human existence. This novel game draws the drama around the “Fog Wanderer”, a murderous apparition scaring a small village in a Lovecraftian world. Help the villagers to solve the murder mystery and discover your own fate which seems to be oddly woven into the entire drama. A philosophical story is built upon inspiration coming from the book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying . Videogames such as Alone in the Dark 1 , The Last Door and the famous Lucas Arts games significantly influenced the general tone and coloring of the game, as well as the art of H.P. Lovecraft and E.A. Poe . The game’s innovative mix of pixelart and low-poly rendering has attracted a lot of interest among players and artists. Synopsis When you awake, you find yourself trapped in a gloomy cave. Dim candle light reveals strange symbols and cult objects all over this place. You can’t remember what happened, but this place gives you shivers. There is a tiny ray of light in the distance which might lead to a room beyond this darkness. Outside the cave you find yourself in a forest which is surrounded by deep gorges and thick layers of fog. A crowd of people lives here in fear of an ominous apparition that creeps through the fog for manhunt. Help the villagers to solve the mystery of the murderous fog wanderer and uncover the fate that brings you to this place. Gameplay Simplified control of the game can be learned fast and allows a quick start. No strong prior experiences with computer games are needed for playing A Room Beyond. All interactions can be accomplished by clicking or dragging the mouse pointer. The game does not define specific timing so that players can take their time to explore the virtual world. Additonal game features are unlocked gradually while progressing storyline. Technology &amp; Style 2.5D Perspective: The game’s visual perspective is known as 2.5D, which describes a combination of 3D effects in a general 2D stage design. Both types bring their own benefits to the game: Interaction and navigation is easy in a 2D scenery, but visual perception of depth is increased by using 3D objects. Pixel Style: Manual and procedural processing steps create a mosaic-like pixel effect which results in a graphical abstraction that increases the scope of visual interpretation and stimulates players’ imagination. Combination of both, smooth animations brought by modern technology and the look and feel of retro pixel game design leads to a fresh contemporary graphic style.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","[]","“Excellent cliff-hangers.

974930,"Eternal Realm II: Dark Matter","Nov 21, 2018","0 - 20000",0,0,3.99,0,0,"The Eternal Realm was created a millenium ago by the king Zerberus. It is a world filled with Dark Matter, a substance that grants immortality and the ability to create virtual worlds. However, living in such a dark world can make one insane. The king and his creations have lived in this peaceful yet, disturbing world for ages but, those times are about to come to an end. The 'Realm Breaker' is about to shatter everyone's perspective of what 'reality' really is. Archimedes, a member of the 'Royal Seed' has embarked on creating a new world with characters using life-like A.I. The player characters he created are now the rulers of this world, but, in name only. Almost as soon as Archimedes gives them the kingdom, a strange abyss phenomena starts appearing all over the land. The ten heroes set out to save their world against this new threat. Meanwhile, in the Eternal Realm, Archimedes' project is sabotaged and now he and his friends are branded as traitors. Who is this unknown enemy lurking in the shadows? Why is he framing Archimedes? This game is part II of the 'Royal War Saga'. Part I of the game was a satire of the jrpg genre. Playing this game is helpful but not necessary to understand the story. Eternal Realm II takes on a more serious tone and develops the characters and story a great deal more. Important Characters: Warrior : Arrogant and self-proclaimed king of the realm Berserker : Stupid, naive, and friendly. Good at killing things with his ax. Sentine l: Always calm. Never says anything. Defender : Chivalrous and valiant. He always talks in capital letters. Hunter : Usually normal but, has multiple personalities Rogue : Lazy and sneaky. Just likes to chill. Ice Mage : Cowardly and shy. Flame Mage : Lunatic. Randomly says morbid things and like to burn things with his flames. Thunder Mage : Typical air-headed girl. Earth Mage : Scholarly individual that likes to use big words. Most find him boring. Archimedes : Creator of the guild; he has been branded a traitor by the king because of the 'Realm Breaker' incident. Balthasar, Chronos, Dinah : Archimedes' friends that assisted him in activating Realm Breaker. Eldrick, Nara, Merlock : Members of the Royal Seed sent out to capture Archimedes. Yarin : The eldest of the Royal Seed. He has lived for over 900 years. King Zerberus : King and creator of the Eternal Realm. He has ruled over this world for over 1000 years. Features: 2 difficulty modes (Normal and Easy) Free-Turn Stamina Battle System (mixture of SMT Nocturne and Chrono Cross) 10 playable characters Over 90 different enemy types Several optional mini-bosses Non-random encounters Full recovery after every battle Save anywhere 2 different endings The Free-turn Stamina battle system allows you to take 4 actions per turn. The actions can be divided up between the characters as you see fit as long as they have the stamina to carry out the action. Characters recover 30-40% of their stamina per turn and the 'Rest' command allows an extra 40% to be recovered. It's the same battle system from Eternal Realm but, now with more options, diversity of abilities, and a more balanced difficulty level. Now you can switch characters out during battles and change accessories to fit the situation. If you like a good rpg that actually makes you think during battles and isn't just 'mash x to continue' then this game is for you.

839770,"Phoenix Point","Dec 3, 2020","200000 - 500000",542,0,24.99,0,7,"Phoenix Point is the acclaimed strategy game from the creator of X-COM, now with Steam Workshop support! The Earth has been overrun. A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the invasion and reverse the inevitable. The Phoenix Project looks to you for leadership. Research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield. Just remember: you're not alone out there. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as a variety of offshoot subfactions, have their own values, goals, and view of the Pandorans. Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy. Phoenix Point Features: Tons of Content: Over two years of updates, upgrades, fixes, and new content suggested by our community, including Steam Workshop support for subscribing and enabling mods, tweaking existing mods, and setting up your game the way you want to play. Try our example 'Custom Camapign' mod to set up new unique campaigns. Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced. Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Engage with a complex narrative, complete with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via several playthroughs. Explore, research, and discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself. Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them. Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass. Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Integrating the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","“Elegant, atmospheric, and energetic, [Julian] Gollop’s latest remains remarkably hard to put down.” 8/10 – PCGamesN “If you like XCOM then you’re going to love Phoenix Point.” 9/10 – Trusted Reviews “Phoenix Point is, without a doubt, one of the best strategy games to come out in the last few years.” 9/10 – Noisy Pixel","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/header.jpg?t=1658422567","https://phoenixpoint.info/","https://phoenixpoint.info/support","support@snapshotgames.com",True,True,False,74,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/phoenix-point?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,3087,1188,"",47,3237,"Phoenix Point contains depictions of science-fiction combat, including the use of guns, energy weapons, explosives, melee weapons, and other military-style devices.

Be careful what you do or say for every choice will have some consequences in the future, for the past choices cannot be rewritten! The gameplay of Introvert Quest will feature mostly dialogue based adventuring, concentrated on a multiple choice system. Choices will impact future events and interaction with other characters inhabiting Sky City. Introvert Quest also features JRPG style battles, but not as a main focus (mostly optional, plus an entire optional mini game aspect: Digital Duels a game that a lot of people play). Battles will be turn based with highly animated attacks.

But don’t worry, all the levels are designed so that you can always win the match. Your mission as Leonard, the White King, is to protect the White Kingdom against the marching army of undead.

Our campaign mode has 64 levels, its story is supported by cinematics. We have a random level generator, which provides you procedural challenges.

Great cheap price for something so enjoyable! ” 5 minutes of game: 'XWallpaper - это забавный и мощный движок для живых обоев, который отображает удивительные анимации и эффекты на ваших обоях с низкой загрузкой процессора.” (Translate: 'XWallpaper is a fun and powerful live wallpaper engine that displays amazing animations and effects on your low CPU wallpaper. ”) 爱の鉴赏家： ”推陈出新，她真的非常棒！初看到的时候我是有些不以为然的。因为动态壁纸领域，早有Wallpaper Engine作为领头老大哥，很多后起之秀，只不过都是模仿之作，而且其中大多数不过个赚个噱头，质量远远不如前者。可是当我实际用起这款软件，体验简直太棒了！如果非要说Wallpaper Engine有什么缺点，那就是能自由自在下到很多壁纸和壁纸素材，可是仅限于使用，玩家自己的可控性却很低。但是这个新秀，明显有意改善前辈的不足。她不仅仅可以对动态壁纸加入了大量的可控要素，甚至可以说将一些做图软件最实用的功能全都简化之后，再搬进来。在这款软件里，大佬固然可以大展身手，但是新丁也能够获得极佳的动态壁纸制作体验。另外，这款软件还主打一个新功能，就是支持鼠标的单独特效。正如软件介绍中写道：提供数百款漂浮粒子特效(200+)、滤镜特效(20+)、鼠标拖尾轨迹特效(200+)、鼠标点击交互特效(200+)，实则不虚。仅仅是简单的编辑，无论是壁纸还是鼠标点击，瞬间就酷炫了很多。如果想让你的桌面靓丽起来，如果想获得比Wallpaper Engine更好的自由度，这款XWallpaper或许能够成为你电脑桌面的超新星宠儿。“ 小熊饼干: '前所未有，真的，这个软件真的很厉害，Wallpaper Engine这个大家都知道，应该算是动态壁纸的标杆了，但对我来说它只是一个单纯提供别人制作的壁纸的软件，我很羡慕创意工坊里那些大神们制作的令人眼花缭乱的壁纸，美是很美，漂亮是漂亮，但缺少了某些东西，这些东西只有我自己懂，该如何做，当然是自己做一份满足自己的壁纸，但是，很难，对我来说太难了，我连业余都算不上，那些繁琐复杂的制作步骤让我望而却步。但是，xwallpaper能满足我 ，我相信，因为这种傻瓜式制作步骤简直是为我而生。 爱不释手啊爱不释手，轻便，对比Wallpaper Engine更低的cpu占用率，满足了对动态壁纸没有更高要求的人群，当然也满足了像我一样lj配置的爱好者，我不知道steam上还有没有其他的壁纸编辑软件，但这款，是真的打动了我。' 17173萤火虫： “一款UI精简清爽的动态壁纸软件，支持创意工坊，功能较丰富，玩家不仅能够找到适合自己的静态或动态壁纸，还可根据需要对图片进行单独的可视化设计，包括添加飘浮粒子，增加滤镜效果，甚至是改变鼠标的点击跟轨迹特效功能。既不占空间也不占内存，总的来说挺实用。。。。' 汉化语录: '《酷鱼动态壁纸》是最近由开发兼发行商XWidgetSoft发布的一款可编辑的动态桌面壁纸软件，使用者可以直接从软件的创意工坊查看动态壁纸的预览并下载，但它最大的优点是，使用者可以根据自己的喜好使用软件内置的各种视觉特效工具来把一张图片变成一个全新的动态壁纸，实现无穷多的可能性，并且产生的动态壁纸还可以直接上传到到创意工坊，软件在使用过程中CPU占用不多。。。' Blacklist_: “这是一款和《Wallpaper Engine》同类的桌面壁纸软件，不过内容上与ui都非常精简，支持创意工坊，壁纸的下载与更换都非常便捷，cpu的占用率也更加的低。但壁纸桌面预览功能个人感觉还不是很完善。 其次，还能够用基础图片自主设计自己的动态壁纸，并可以根据自己的喜好添加特效，鼠标指针的点击，运行轨迹等等也可以设计自己喜欢的特效，支持云，能够上传供其他用户下载。值得尝试的一个软件。”","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/header.jpg?t=1607489848","http://xdesktop.com","http://xdesktop.com","xdesktop@outlook.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,72,71,"",0,128,"",557,0,557,0,"XDesktop","XDesktop","Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor","Animation & Modeling,Design & Illustration,Utilities","Utilities,Design & Illustration,Animation & Modeling","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_b1d3ea368506ed2b572b52a4cd621f9da8a4e15f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_025bb72d196d33192359941d50e193660e5a4905.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_fc75e7674c6504cd05ebc2e976c531d0ea7ecb41.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_63814f52104617fd5f68d16c4fd413c4b1b71879.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_7300607954b6ed31a34928f73819544f9cc4138d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_fb5b1c59896c570e5a8b71a4a24acfdd4dc620d2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_76d879d21a0f279274aec1fd01d5d64fcfe32e6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_ba24ba3fcd7e17b09f271fa37a3d37aa52aece7f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_ef6f30cb676e63f06b3fd30bd3014833b5e8efec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_1b451cd8d843c95637e4247f7c7b980862cf7dd8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_56516ca22d95c97a99d7e047423842f8eee09ca9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256758665/movie_max.mp4?t=1565795573,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256758342/movie_max.mp4?t=1565100720,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763932/movie_max.mp4?t=1570438319,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763944/movie_max.mp4?t=1572261239,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760117/movie_max.mp4?t=1566747400,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256757970/movie_max.mp4?t=1567605898,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759660/movie_max.mp4?t=1566699139,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759351/movie_max.mp4?t=1566175333,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759081/movie_max.mp4?t=1565798208"

It came out of a successful Kickstarter and Greenlight adventure. Since No Time To Explain, we started helping other developers with their games. After getting enough muscle behind our internal studio, we came back to No Time To Explain, and completely remade the game in a proper engine. No Time To Explain Remastered is free for everyone who owns the original!","['English']","['English']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/368730/header.jpg?t=1616776011","http://tinybuild.com","http://tinybuild.com","contact@tinybuildgames.com",True,True,True,0,"",0,1852,496,"",9,1170,"",168,0,112,0,"tinyBuild","tinyBuild","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie","Indie,Action,Adventure,Casual,Platformer,Comedy,Funny,2D,Difficult,Time Travel,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Singleplayer,Gore,Memes,Local Co-Op,Remake,Local Multiplayer,Blood","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/368730/ss_e198175e145b416c4dac0d23049913c0043f151e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1616776011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/368730/ss_f14ead9b6eb6762475d023b62c1e53238c112eb3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1616776011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/368730/ss_f735532d4ebabc9fd1aeeb7634ea8520cb1eaab6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1616776011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/368730/ss_e218bdde8572fe3800a444e1f4196726a2374f58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1616776011,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/368730/ss_f84ce1120ea17b8d7aebd5bd087f7f4f432389d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1616776011","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2040497/movie_max.mp4?t=1447376907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2040498/movie_max.mp4?t=1447376908,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2040499/movie_max.mp4?t=1447376908"

Manage relationships between the different idols in your group, as you deal with cliques, internal feuds, and bullying.

This will not be easy because they have been thrown into parallel worlds dominated by unscrupulous gods, jealous of the magician's power. Despite his intense anger, the Immense Wizard will allow you to use the potions contained in the phials or the magic words inscribed on the scrolls to defend yourself. Then, he will follow you throughout your whole adventure thanks to his crystal ball, and he will use his limitless power to transport you from one world to another and to give you life again should the circumstances prove to be fatal. Nevertheless, his patience is so much limited than his powers. That is why he will only give you life twice after which you will be open to his most dreadful punishment.","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/781240/header.jpg?t=1599611221","https://www.ziggurat.games/","","support@zigguratinteractive.com",True,False,False,0,"",0,4,13,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Infogrames","Ziggurat","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Remote Play Together","Action","Action","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/781240/ss_d3bbcee187bda6f50a465b568f4f55786465b678.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599611221,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/781240/ss_67cf84c8c03e2a8eca59a023a51b853ef29d0d59.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599611221,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/781240/ss_17e24b0d48189bf4427d99c6b29ddc19b68540bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599611221,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/781240/ss_7401982d505a7c59b8b7c4bdbc10e7f54cb98f0c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599611221,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/781240/ss_9b555135b9732b9e5fe87a35aef7ba29948cd0ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599611221","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256705702/movie_max.mp4?t=1599593958"

You play as a small fox a fairytale story with Kings, Queens, and witches. This game is a text-based adventure created with the intention of allowing the user to experience the frustration of being dyslexic. Sentences and words are made intentionally hard to read through different rules of how they are constructed change with every chapter, ranging from a flickering background, jittery letters and PQBS's being swapped around. Choices must be made in a quick time which leads to even more frustration. Much like a book, you could skip to the end of this game thought the chapter select menu but this is supposed to simulate the fact that you can do this but don't get any satisfaction from doing so. You can re-read chapters to see if you can get a better outcome. There are a bunch of options to try to make the game easier to play based on people's common conceptions on what fixes dyslexia. There is an option to add a colored overlay and remove the flicker in an attempt to combat 'Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome/ Irlen Syndrome'. And there is an option to change the font to Open Dyslexic which in my opinion is harder to read. There are options which allow you to play the game in non-dyslexic mode if you want, but wheres the fun in that. The game includes a range of accessibility settings.

We took things from other games and modified them such as “Don’t Starve” when you have to eat to survive and added another mechanic too that he fruit you eat to survive also give buffs to the player as well as useful to survive and progress. You have to jump on platforms and use certain fruit such as the apple which gives you a higher jump height to reach certain platforms or the banana fruit which gives you movement speed so you can jump further or run away from the magician. The core of the gameplay relies on the fruit and the ability to use them in a unique way. You can throw fruit at enemies to stun them as well as collide with them to destroy them. If you’re not the same color as the enemy you’ll take damage but if you are the same color you’ll destroy the enemy without taking damage.","['English']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/header.jpg?t=1525379683","","http://ottercopter.com","",True,False,False,0,"",0,4,0,"",0,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Team TatoTaco","Ottercopter Studios, LLC","Single-player,Full controller support","Adventure,Casual,Indie","Adventure,Indie,Casual","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_6fc291ff55f7fb1fa348579a705bf999de75382b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_1dc832d4e0b218ed436a0c1faa7c4fab0b657840.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_50fb62dc6a402c048bf1ec35f4100553066bb932.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_796a31cb8955473b94b10d683433a8cbbf645f10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_df50c2e30efdd1577280fe9e7c2c3652d34848a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256713429/movie_max.mp4?t=1522979943"

We got so used to it that news from Syria has become trivial. We've even already forgotten how it all started, and where the roots of the terrible terror lie – the terror that swept across Europe in recent years. Syria is all over the news, and it's become a subject of many documentaries. We, however, want to show the story through the lens of the game and don't let the word 'game' mislead you. This game does not claim to be a history lesson, but it shows the course of the war in all its seriousness through the major milestones, from the first days till the latest important victories over terror. What kind of a game is it? Syrian Warfare is a real time strategy with a high degree of realism. This game is not about a base construction or units production. The player will have to determine their forces characteristics before they go into action. And during the mission, they would be able to select reinforcements in order to support the troopers. The troops and machinery crews move from mission to mission and gain experience, which helps them increase their effectiveness. Trophies captured by the player on the battlefield can be used throughout the whole campaign. Importantly enough, there are no «life bars» for vehicles in the game. Damages are calculated by taking into account the protection module and the power of adverse factors. Inflicted damages affect the functioning of the module. In the battlefield, it is impossible to repair the armor, but one can repair the modules by using a limited stock of spare parts. Ammunition and fuel are also limited. A system of high-quality physical demolition of buildings and other objects is used in the game (it does not only look spectacular, but it has a serious influence on the tactics during the missions, especially in urban areas). The game has a wide set of tactical possibilities: The storming of buildings, usage of smokescreens, infantry lift by helicopters and APC/IFV, air strike calls, capturing of trophy weapons and equipment, usage of heat flares and active defense complexes. And of course the story itself. We will try to show the conflict, not from a point of view of a general, located somewhere at the ‘top’. No, it will be a story of a man, who lived in the country that descended into hell. A story of struggle, loss and regained hope.","['English', 'Russian', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","“Качественная реалистичная RTS, практически не имеющая современных аналогов и конкурентов и способная растопить сердце самого либерального любителя стратегий.
